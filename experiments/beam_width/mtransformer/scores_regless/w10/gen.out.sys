thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
seriously .
one ?
is that possible ?
well , yeah .
that &apos;s true .
this is what you can do .
thank you .
1.5 million .
you need time .
thank you .
and he says ...
is that all of them ?
this is fast going on .
that &apos;s not ...
great trick ?
that &apos;s hard .
thank you .
yeah . okay .
i &apos;m tom .
here it is .
that was us .
... not yet .
we were poor .
a few less .
we know that .
yeah , hello .
oh my god .
that &apos;s what singing is about .
what does that mean ?
solar is ...
from seattle ...
ta-da !
music as a language .
that &apos;s wrong .
we love innovation .
hold twice .
after a week .
it &apos;s interesting .
what does that mean ?
don &apos;t happen .
i don &apos;t know .
three out of 10 .
thank you . thank you !
it &apos;s terrible .
oh my god !
we lose them .
home where ?
we love entertainment .
i can help .
i don &apos;t know .
but it &apos;s there .
does that sound good ?
a lot .
we take off .
the only chance .
tell them .
they &apos;re all important .
and she did .
wonderful , huh ?
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s actually me .
what a fish .
that was incredible .
long , yes .
thank you .
yes , in a way .
fantastic , right ?
the sun goes up .
stephen watts .
no hospital either .
ban is blank .
nothing is happening at all .
it &apos;s a crisis .
a few more .
pretty good , right ?
it &apos;s generic .
i was amazed .
completely inefficient .
what did they do ?
that &apos;s efficient .
incredibly exciting .
so they meet al .
very different term .
it &apos;s essential .
not very sustainable .
he opens the door .
what &apos;s happened here ?
what do you say then ?
oh , so that one .
they have similar principles .
why no longer live ?
sounds familiar , what ?
thank you very much .
so they knew everything .
robert gupta .
1,000 , very good .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
that was fascinating .
the farm is incredible .
that &apos;s terribly important .
good work ! yes !
hey , why not ?
lento , slowly .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
but you know what ?
can i be honest ?
and that &apos;s important .
yeah , good day .
yeah , good day .
this is our present .
what &apos;s happened here ?
this is the system .
just do your job .
centers were built .
there is no normal .
this was the result .
you could see manhattan .
it has sensors .
yeah , i know .
all the environmental discussion .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
flying cat .
why do we do that ?
they use their hands .
i don &apos;t know .
we can do that .
these people make money .
what was the result ?
that &apos;s very good .
reevaluate them .
but you know what ?
yes , milliseconds .
here &apos;s the video .
it &apos;s not a country .
yeah , that can be done .
and i was an artist .
what do these people need ?
how interested they are .
let &apos;s call it don .
so how does this work ?
we can do it differently .
this is a wish .
because you know what ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
how do we know this ?
i have a question .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i don &apos;t think so .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
can we change it ?
what is media today ?
that would have been okay .
i was facing him .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so they do that .
here &apos;s an example .
so let &apos;s see .
these days are over .
i thought about it .
bg : thank you .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
you can go in .
this is the last one .
not school management .
players don &apos;t sit around .
thank you .
why does this happen at all ?
you see it immediately .
not toxic in there .
but i kept working .
there are two possibilities .
i &apos;m going in here .
and i kept working .
we need energy miracles .
okay . thank you .
let me tell you .
what do you want to do ?
oh . a moment .
so she was back .
this is what &apos;s happening to us today .
or before bombs .
i &apos;m a writer .
i hire kids .
be a mentor .
maybe 10 times as many of you .
first of all , limited .
jk : both .
it &apos;s against justice .
why should we do that ?
and i understand that .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i swear it .
they even hurt .
thank you for listening .
i wonder .
it feels great .
imagine the camera .
what creates the illusion ?
an enormous challenge .
there &apos;s no food .
but it didn &apos;t have that .
here &apos;s another example .
i created one .
and so it was .
again , my gut feeling .
the data came in .
but the wrong things .
here you see it now .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
yeah . all right .
after just one journey there .
thank you very much .
people were playing crazy .
there are online criminals .
let me summarize .
there were remixes .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
some have come and left .
that &apos;s a great question .
he always pointed back here .
but it gets worse .
there &apos;s an old study .
it keeps you fresh .
and then it became international .
good afternoon , everybody together .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
does anybody see anything particular ?
he loved it very much .
here you see the city .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s not our problem .
but there &apos;s something else .
i mean the soul .
okay , a few more .
is it even photography ?
i &apos;ll never forget .
in china , it was different .
but this is no protection .
here &apos;s another example .
and then it happened again .
that &apos;s a great question .
thankfully not , yes ?
dk : 60,000 .
i totally agree with you .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
it would be intolerable .
that &apos;s what she did secretly .
and that &apos;s what i always had .
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
you hire comparison .
and why is that ?
he had had the experience .
very expensive real estate .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
yes , here it is .
ohhh .
crisis . death . disaster .
just keep on . lots of fun .
and it got better .
the answer to that is no .
give pee a chance .
am i going to like the color ?
and a lot of people forget this .
who will make it secure ?
is that also your opinion ?
ooh , thank you .
privacy must be given .
my name is amit .
we have three main groups .
it has billions of them .
i felt really good .
they were still fish .
what would all have to be done ?
i don &apos;t think so .
did you see these guys ?
i &apos;ll never forget that .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
so , what does that mean ?
i grew up in india .
so what happened years after that ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
how do we actually work for people ?
the only country in the world .
they look like this .
let &apos;s call it don as well .
don &apos;t be discouraged .
but where are we useful ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
that &apos;s not true of emotion .
the work of interpreting it .
this is the short run .
but what do your fish eat ?
is it about light ?
i was devastated .
who are these relatives ?
you see the water coming .
first we have the population .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
... invent his own story .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
now , what does that mean ?
the game is from 2007 .
this is preconceived .
now what do you think happened ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i had a good life .
i want to ask you something .
but what do we do with this ?
he went up and down .
that &apos;s what most people here know .
this sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;re constantly bumping each other .
that &apos;s kind of it .
is it going to be my size ?
we need to spread the message .
his name is tempt .
this is what you see down there .
we love technology and creativity .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
what do i look at ?
why not think about it that way ?
you also have to understand that .
actually , i made two mistakes .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
this is what the chart looked like .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
you can &apos;t have bones .
it may sound silly .
we were 20 people .
and this opens a map .
we &apos;re too many .
it would be mindless .
or is it possible ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
conflict comes creativity .
this is felix .
so what do we need to do ?
what else can we do ?
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
these changes are coming .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
and then they set it up .
here &apos;s how it works .
how about fitness ?
but the crucial thing is ...
what actually happened there ?
the orange tractor .
but i felt worse .
legendary technology .
they called me the two .
very scary .
i can say anything .
we don &apos;t produce ourselves anymore .
what is the soul ?
and finally , epic meaning .
again , here you have it again .
she connected these two people .
they want to feed the world ?
first extension , second extension .
that was the beginning of the journey .
this is from this place .
one place is south korea .
so why is this hacking ?
i don &apos;t have to worry !
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
well , i was the next .
the same thing , just bigger .
they really loved it .
my wife told me .
because that &apos;s what you can train .
and how did that feel ?
i was grappled .
and then everybody went down .
sometimes i push too much .
i wanted to support them .
the answer is yes .
but it was very sad .
and it worked very well .
what is this thing ?
is that curious ?
this is very risky .
but they do the job .
and this is the crux .
they could have done better .
her mother pulled her on her own .
they saw the big impact .
this is what happened at christmas .
she shares her experiences with others .
i only loved two .
so it &apos;s n circle .
think about your own decisions .
and it took 18 months .
so anyway , you know .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
thank you for your attention .
this is such a natural thing .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
i see this plussical sign .
tell me about this world .
well , let &apos;s want that one .
eye-opening should still work .
the data had not been available before .
it &apos;s not our burden .
you can have that cloud .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
and there are hundreds of them .
it was my first sunburn .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
how many people would choose creativity ?
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
is that reasonable ?
that &apos;s how you feel . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
it was a huge success .
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
the power plant can explode .
now , how did this happen ?
they come from artists .
does anybody know what that is ?
i learned everything memorized .
this is a game for outside .
but it &apos;s not going so fast .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
she was back and she was dying .
that made me really sad .
so let me remind you .
people were still happy .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
what happened that day ?
they always say , why ?
again , he was chasing him .
so they saw something magical .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
so , we can do that .
no , no had never been an opportunity .
he actually collected fish .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
play is not silly .
for example , that perception in context .
this is god , you know ?
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was just not invented yet .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
she did it for three years .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
2.5 to one , great .
how can we help you ? &quot;
no one has ever said this before .
and it was an incredible experience .
but you know what ?
what should our testimony look like ?
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
the whole building was made of water .
is this all education ?
so not like detox .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
but there are two problems with this .
the story is not over yet .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
my name is brian goldman .
and there &apos;s good news .
they can play with different kinds of things .
and then something weird happened .
and then we did that .
i mean , that was grandioos .
i talk a lot about these questions .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
they have so much insecurity .
and of course , the incredible job is this .
they create an epic story .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
everybody needs a gold glass .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
the white lines are population .
what other brands are doing this way ?
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
basically they do the same thing .
the data always demonstrates that .
so paul is a terrorist .
let them be sini . &quot;
in the morning , before the game .
i cook almost never with it .
he doesn &apos;t have that soul .
if it &apos;s the garbage right now .
which would you like the most ?
and that &apos;s what we record .
that &apos;s it , quite simply .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
italy wins . yeah .
doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
and this was 19 years ago .
take nothing for granted .
i started to feel better .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
he pointed to the algae .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
and already you have a problem .
below that , other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
and then realizing it .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
an autistic student .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
now this is one of the images .
it just doesn &apos;t work technologically .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
we depend on two countries .
and here &apos;s the representation again .
we went to an area .
so the question is : how ?
this has the biggest impact .
we all love baseball , right ?
they can &apos;t store energy .
slowly but surely it was .
and the shape plays a role .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
my second mistake was worse .
what lessons did we learn ?
and we &apos;re too many of them .
once upon a time , we started a vivid .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
every waste is nutrients .
because does anybody have masses here ?
they become free to computers .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
then i can translate the whole thing .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
and it starts with a doctor .
creativity had to hold out somehow .
asked the nurse about it .
i shouldn &apos;t probably do that .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
because i can say everything .
further than that , we don &apos;t go .
it gets more and more similar to them .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
this is all metadata .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
okay , that makes a really courage .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , doesn &apos;t it ?
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
nowadays everything is easy .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
hmmm , my brand ?
thank you for your patience .
this is completely trivial .
but very effective , yes ?
let &apos;s have that quiet .
next , nuclear energy .
what else is risky ?
this is scary .
that sounds frightening .
i got a little scared of technology .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
we can &apos;t do it simple .
as soon as the judge saw me ?
so i went to the court .
i really wanted to be normal at the time .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
nullemissions , right ?
why did i go to medicine ?
anyway , not to navigate .
so , see what happens .
i &apos;m shooting something through my head .
the movements to write it .
now i was trying a little bit more exciting .
what is a story going on ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
dark urin . dark .
but we need that overall .
i remember my first fire .
her family gathered up .
just be who you are .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
so i just started playing .
this is like speaking learning .
i like things that are different .
and this video is in real time .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
it &apos;s not documented .
so you can do something from nothing .
all adults were aware of the risks .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
have you ever been envy ?
do you want to ensure jeans with holes ?
the game starts -- silence .
the truth is more like this .
so the correlation is small .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
and that &apos;s in the very beginning .
and then we said , okay .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
we say sustainability in germany .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
it can know where we are .
how did he feel ?
it &apos;s spreading fast .
it really changed the dynamics .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i went to jail -- difficult .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
because to me , it means memory .
what about longevity ?
they sell certificates .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
and do you know what i learned ?
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
they were genetically expressed .
do we really want to go this way ?
i find them disgusting .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
you can show i was there .
this is a picture of the object .
that has to be the difference of aging .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
you see something fun there .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
do you know what it &apos;s tired ?
music is medicine . music is changing to us .
privacy is not a debate .
this picture reminded me of something .
lego made it possible for everybody .
and there are several reasons for this .
i really like beautiful clothes .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because we live on a water planet .
he can only use his eyes .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
these will be irresistible .
baseball is full of great statistics .
oh , my time has been over ?
something got inside me .
so the first step to an interpretation .
i could draw . i could paint .
we started this 15 years ago .
you can do it all the time .
anyway , we need a solution .
it seemed pretty popular .
but the truth is far from it .
and that can make a big difference .
so we measured its movement .
they are an inspiring personality .
we can regain our nutrients .
if you come up with that , right ?
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
and these are neural structures .
how far do you even get there ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and still it &apos;s not an interpretation .
on the book and on the image .
it makes leukemia in kids .
five million people use it every month .
now i see greg lemond .
okay , you really want to know ?
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
for one year we didn &apos;t have a cents .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
sunlight and co2 are a way .
but it requires a lot of planning .
that &apos;s what i stop , thank you very much .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
they flew the canals .
that has nothing to do with science .
this is the minimum .
i fell in love with this fish .
this is a very sensitive question .
he was more than six .
but then they really want deep inside .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
and this sounds very different than before .
this is affecting the memory basin .
it was a pretty fond project .
the defeat would have been too simple .
that was more to concrete .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t want healthier kids ?
and every morning , i jumped on it .
who would ever want one ?
here he &apos;s leaving the sun .
i want to prove that to you .
and the goal here is very simple .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so this crazy story could be true .
and what does that mean to the designer ?
i &apos;m pushing my sleeping back .
our magazines are read by millions .
no , i mean it really seriously .
i hold the knife in my hand .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
we &apos;ve won some prizes .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
they want to orient themselves in the museum ?
i started with my usual talk .
her father died shortly after she was born .
here &apos;s her march gang .
and i had to get out of the city .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
it &apos;s all about changing standards .
we didn &apos;t write that app .
we can reinvent everything again .
who do you really want to inform with this ?
my brother stared at me .
we need to think about what brands are .
a has these benefits and these risks .
these rivers are rapidly accepted .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
here &apos;s a description of the street .
the stones are color coded .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
a billion people are going to starve today .
no , no , it can &apos;t .
i learned this from my grandmother .
bjdorn sundin .
who could have predicted all this ?
i call this the bright tiger .
and it depends on phosphorus .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of procedures .
oh my god . oh my god .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
very simply , this is how it &apos;s going to come .
what will you do with this ? &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about shattering .
here &apos;s olive oil going on .
often in the third one , forgot again .
they even bring in funding .
and that got me so disturbed ...
this is ideology , not science .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
automatically , it walks to the right thought .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
the film hasn &apos;t been released yet .
they &apos;re called projectors today .
i talked a lot about magic .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
it &apos;s been longer than these two networks .
i started an institute on this .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
these are the apsaras .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
this may be broadcast publicly .
that &apos;s how natural things are imagined .
as we think from north , we think .
the living ones give rise to the spirits .
and nobody seems to get upset about that .
there are also world records .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes something .
the other one had huge diarrhea .
in what words would you describe ban ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it before .
they gave her blood pressure up .
people over the urine .
fantastic ! this machine &apos;s pretty loud .
we &apos;ve reached some kind of equilibrium .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
thank you , but the best part is still coming .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
he died , broken through history .
completely targeted to a particular target .
tell me what you feel .
it &apos;s interested in fire .
let &apos;s make a little intersection .
here you have this little mechanism .
that &apos;s where he signed up .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
they &apos;re very good at this .
students are divided by grades .
and here you already feel it .
i came up with this for energy .
all of these generations take only a few milliseconds .
i tried to understand them .
these things are logically correct .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
i &apos;d written these crazy things .
that sounds kind of unusual for the first time .
we &apos;ve put unique elements in here .
so there are two cycles going on .
now we saw the reverse effect .
let &apos;s start with perceiving .
here &apos;s how the building works .
they brought their pictures , right ?
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
i hope you forgive me .
i hire people in death cells .
they kept us from being inspired .
it will deeply touch it .
they went through each other .
so this is a tough nose .
lead maybe some mutations .
so i followed my gut feeling .
they have them . they always have them .
we worked at night until late .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
the drives just belong to our lives .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
... so means , not so optimistic .
they literally surrounded the lever .
especially if it &apos;s died already .
now look at this curve .
politely , everybody applauded .
so scott gets this anesthesia .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
it has been constant .
the next product is clean water .
it &apos;s about a recovery of america .
we &apos;re talking about it in ambiguity .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
a dalmatiner , right .
the main man blew me up .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
he removed to silence .
we go through initiation rituals .
he turns off the drives .
and curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
so from modern to computer society .
there was jimmy kimmula coming .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
it may take a long time for it to be invited .
this is not usually the route .
how would you describe your brand ?
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe in .
we also got very accurate data .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
something very strange happens here .
we can support them to be good .
these are all interintuitive questions .
but with the right design , here we go .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
it was truly profound .
this is a painting of a circle .
even cats look at this video .
you first see from the back to the front .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
but i kept asking myself these questions .
this is also a paradigm shift .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
the roof was also covered with water .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
you should also want something .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
and women did it successfully .
we can support them to be good .
this is the system we live in .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
they had a concept of blue blood .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
i see the dalmatiner .
what takes five milliseconds ?
you &apos;re someone &apos;s home countries .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
we need to get a long way , fast .
this is going to happen in the next april .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
they tap into their internet connection .
but today we are way beyond that .
i thought everybody could do that .
he shaped his head , no .
we &apos;re talking about cookie , fresh .
tempt is now completely paralyzed .
so there is a feedback .
make it possible -- all of you here .
so littalive &apos;s open source .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
and why ? genetically modified food .
daniel kahneman : sure .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people later .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
the thing that &apos;s just been represented .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and there are quite a few collaborators .
and i want to read them to you .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
does anybody even know what that is ?
this is an ecological network .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
i lived in parallel worlds .
we now have masses in this country .
not even the truth will release it .
maybe i did it well .
someone made an old-fashioned version of it .
so the first exciting primate .
and that was the outbreak .
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
you can be logical and intuitive .
no , no , far missing .
the bank is from another place .
that &apos;s such a tangible part .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them out . &quot;
the chef had cooked it .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
also , dosification plays a role .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
i learned a few very simple things .
tell me a little bit about that part .
by itself , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
everybody would like to make people happier .
and also these sources underlie interruptions .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
maybe even have to look beyond that again .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
156 nations send our tv channel .
we can give ourselves something like this .
these kinds of things don &apos;t exist with us .
you put in boxes like this .
his personal impressions of the seaeroses .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
it can know how we hold it .
thank you , danny kahneman .
they grew up five centimeters .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
this is a modest little app .
there &apos;s never been a time like this before .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
a lot of my clients are very young .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you see the timeline on the top .
what you need is a new medical culture .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
and then what do you do with the garbage ?
there &apos;s a lot of stuff that needs to come together .
this guy in the middle is not so much .
here are two different jewelry plants .
it &apos;s a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
i &apos;m going to try this through an example .
that &apos;s what he has to process first as a present .
i have it here on my laptop . &quot;
and then he can walk off .
all of a shells of cool whip eat .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
my cousins were walking all over the place .
i think our identity is threatened .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
they lead the process , they understand it .
we get an absolutely flat line of this .
this is an annual diving river .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
it was a grouper .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
bad ? i was completely confused .
alone , shamed and without help .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
i get tired , just like all of us .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
it should contain the two elements again .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
and anyway , italy ended up winning .
but the game is a formal transducer .
now the next step is happening within these communities .
let &apos;s pull out something else now .
it all comes from our own pockets .
a language is expression of the human mind .
this is just an insurance method .
shake the environment , make less waste .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
as an artist , i &apos;m really interested in the correlation .
well then i &apos;m going to show it to you .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
this is my supermarket . this is not a big market .
this , by the way , is just the work tile .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
this is one , a part of her .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
yes . it does nothing but discover .
it just didn &apos;t occur , you know ?
thank you . i have a question for you .
that really solves the fuel problem .
and it was an ecological disaster .
but western governments also help themselves .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a second .
here you see roberto dancing .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
so basically , a translation of translation .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
no insurance can squeeze .
there are lots of great books on this topic .
the emergency staff was moving all the strands .
so far , this has been a problem for supercomputers .
and further , now you always see him .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
what are i applying for ?
it &apos;s great that number is going up .
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
you can predict that . why is that ?
isn &apos;t it enough to cut half or a quarter ? &quot;
no tree is carbon neutral .
it builds up everywhere in two hours .
monday : color is something powerful .
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum guy .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
they make us feel worse about us .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
imagine mozart efficiently .
and then it usually looks like this .
so , help me a little bit about this .
do you remember the angle again ?
or take a lip pen .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
by now , the instruments have evolved .
three paragraph you know from high school .
didn &apos;t actually want to make a viral video .
i want to explain that a little bit for a second .
in this three-sentence , there are three sentences .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
now , what are archaic models ?
if you burn natural gas , no .
you know , everybody &apos;s eaten cake .
second half-time . end of the normal game time .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
say there are no forecasts .
if you burn coal , no .
and you can continue the list endlessly .
you know that science is not a company .
it kind of wired us up .
we wondered , and nobody knew .
the water sheets have expanded .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so , that really blew my mind .
we think of energy nowadays .
no , we realize what &apos;s inside of it .
that &apos;s what the norm says about it .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
people suffered . people fought .
can you also play them in blue now ?
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s a game called folc .
let me show you how they work .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
imagine that for a moment .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
maybe we can see the drives as a change .
you can zoom in very easily and out of it .
raise your hands . let me see .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
but it has an unexpected twist .
i thought i could integrate .
my fourth technique : requirement for complexity .
now you see the dalmatiner .
you can jump directly to a certain output .
three : escalation of expectations .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
shake the environment , consume less energy .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
i call it the &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
keep america new . find out more .
you go around and amuse yourself .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
you just listen , and then you start talking .
if not , squawk somebody else today .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
life had not changed for centuries .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
and the two more recent ones are also here today .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
we still think they &apos;re original .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and let me show you a simple example .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
my parents are the 80 on the heels .
if you think about it a little further now .
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
you come in two ways -- very simple .
the three words were : do you remember ?
we refuse genetically modified food .
you can dive in to a particular year .
they laughed more than you do here .
because that &apos;s kind of illuminating , right ?
my grandmother never forgot me his life .
well , i went to the court .
the official dogma of what ?
it summarizes thousands of square kilometers .
we forgot them . puff .
i tried to preserve the body .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
donnerday : confidence is the key .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
your problem is you don &apos;t have too little .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
intersexuality emerges in many different forms .
but i didn &apos;t discourage from that .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
i &apos;m adding a barrel now .
what ? that really freaked me out .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
third technique : categorization .
but so many got help over the years .
this is called the osite model .
it was something we knew to do .
no one has to give a green light to your ideas .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
they were just like the people in this room .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and yes , i &apos;ll go on a slide again .
what do you do with certificates ?
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
so put them out ; save your shoes .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
i think i may have heard more hands .
seriously -- the decline is expanding !
our goal was to say , okay .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in it that &apos;s useful .
scott was talking about human beings .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is like .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
and this is very important in medical research .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
then he whispered in my ear .
nevertheless , we seem to be quite pleased with this .
and this is a million-dollar concert .
and if not , still dance .
we &apos;re hoped we don &apos;t need that .
so that made sense , it fit together .
anyway , they do this in it .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
let me show you from near .
so at this point we need digital security systems .
shame . shame .
and in time , they can react again .
this is alfred gonzalez .
this must be down here , down to zero .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
so again , that fit really well together .
what would you say to someone who thinks that ?
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
and here &apos;s every piece that &apos;s very well planned .
we need to be interested in more research funds .
there can be a series of changes .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
there &apos;s a lot of luck coaching .
is it about the details or the colors ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and we keep increasing our expectations all the time .
so two couples , each one has a baby .
picasso answeres , just wait .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
so you can &apos;t put them in the wrong way .
well , this cartoon makes a few statements .
all of these are composable .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
this is being balanced in china in a second .
what we want is to create the future .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
and i went back to work .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
natural light then offers smart-grid .
next week it comes to the market .
today , a lot of people have given up to the government .
no one in the world has done that yet .
usually i would take out the needle .
this becomes a key element of this stuff .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
i was completely excited about science , you know .
now i &apos;m going to do some more stuff about this .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demonstration .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
storytelling needs more and more senses .
it &apos;s the way i like to be .
the question is , why do people accept that ?
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
first of all , i thought this was a game .
and every night they fly back 240 kilometers .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here .
and they had to remove what we were doing .
at first we just signed up .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
that &apos;s why i think we must be leaders .
they live with chemosynthesis help .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and silicon .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re delocalized .
on the left you see a little boat .
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masses .
every morning they fly 50 miles to the farm .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
and try this again with another generation .
no one wanted to be involved in the movie .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what do you think the answer will be ?
she &apos;s got a button , on / out .
what is the food processing ? &quot;
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
these things have a more positive effect .
let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
it supports people when others talk about their mistakes .
do you know what you call a 400,00th ?
i don &apos;t want to do anything different in life .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i didn &apos;t want to leave ; i love my life .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
i want to show you something too first here .
and of course , it then clicked .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
the best part is still -- in a second .
i start with some simple examples .
when i was 16 , i started illustrating books .
and i have to say , it gave me power .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
i put her on treatment , and i went to my treatment .
and i &apos;d like to suggest that that &apos;s good .
and we want to make this material available to everybody .
so on the subject of the day : financial saving .
notice two things on this curve .
they don &apos;t invest time in power fights .
what happened was that we could do that .
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
for example , the sneaker , right ?
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
this is how they communicate -- this is how their fingers walk along .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
we want to do something about death penalty .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
there are some very interesting developments .
and everything is packaging or content .
and still maintain a realistic level .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
this is a problem many players have .
and we still need to improve a lot on this device .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
so each concert is a different concert .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
so smart grid , huge topic everywhere .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
so don &apos;t save , forget , avoid .
anyway . i certainly want that .
technical cycles are the same way .
we don &apos;t get an identity ; we invent it .
i highlighted it in particular here .
at first the tribal society through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from outside to human .
that would roll upon you about the country .
now everybody from this pattern is trying to see something .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge to offer that for nine .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you for a moment .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
everybody who was like this began to divide .
i &apos;m really sorry . is this crazy ?
he came up to me and hugged me .
it was a lot of off , and i was in eile .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
in the countries where people are getting money .
i have something here that i want to show you .
this is an entirely unsustainable pattern of development .
it has molecular weight of over 300 million .
this is a dead turtle .
you saw it wardly in the news .
they &apos;ve reversed the river of water .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
and what does it actually look like in there ?
and in that head the memory was played .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
store them off , dissolve the rest .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
and give back to my chief doctor .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
i want to help you calm down .
we want to lower the number of prisoners .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
but what happens to citizens is different .
how about living longer at good health ?
there are these winds everywhere around , almost close .
did you take all your vitamins this morning ?
so that was a very strange experience .
the dedication of dna was an interesting step .
no apple ever tasted that way again .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was her head .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
i &apos;m wearing jeans almost all the time .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
all of this summarizes up are errors inevitable .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
both of them are survivable , both of them are alive .
as i said , amanda is our elephant .
there were no cantaloupe-melons .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
so they were just tiles for him .
the silence is ocar-numbing .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
i was not familiar with the label .
at one point i thought he had kidney stones .
so you don &apos;t lose animals very often .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
that means we need to get back phosphorus .
it &apos;s sort of like our fight .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
and we see it going through .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
here are a few more people testing it .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
there seems to be a disagreement there .
they &apos;re getting rarer because we start them .
so they can pull the whole movement .
and i become a character in the book .
so each droplet was a little bit different .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
it &apos;s not all meant to be composable .
do you know how many people are watching these tedtalks ?
and the answer will probably be probably no .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
so i think the basics are very simple .
but how do you do that in practice ?
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
it &apos;s going to drive the u.s. for hundreds of years .
i did my job at 95 kilos .
i think the first one is curiosity .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
good night , cute thylacine . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
and all of this leads to a big question ...
and that worked . applause for scott .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
interpretation is barely talked about in the early class .
look , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
here are the results we just got .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
there are those that are much more spatial .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
we found that it was really strange .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
and this was not a hard diagnosis .
... that the doses also play a role .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
he &apos;s just deceiving you and not yourself .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence at all .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
i was an obsessive obsessional student .
she had the last word in every family conflict .
it &apos;s sort of a behavior poop print .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
so , that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
this is footage over six seconds .
because the notes are the only connection directly with him .
well , really good , maybe an all-star .
or they didn &apos;t have a photolitography .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
i learned that , in a moment , everything &apos;s different .
the marshmallow must be on top of it .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
this is just online -- no press , no television .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
many of you probably know this trick in this room .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
but bothering isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us any money .
and we use this word with such a contempt .
wealth , not debt , is affecting the outcome .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor in the scene .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen that .
because we can &apos;t live without that life .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
if your job is dance , dance .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
so my two passions kind of flew out .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
we have 1.5 billion players overall .
this is a game i have to say .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
i made a decision to move to the united states .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
i can surround the sequence as you walk .
or are they more of a down attribute ?
designing a phrase with your own breath .
for nathaniel , music means soul health .
i want to tell you how we figured that out .
yeah , what kind of projects are we actually doing now ?
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
well , let me show you a little bit more of it .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
but one of them is far worse than the other .
this is the kind of educational shame .
this is the call center for service and information .
but are we going to do the best thing out of our play drive ?
she barely breathed , and she walked blue .
here we were , and this is the painting .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
from avian age to machine age .
it &apos;s nateness , and it &apos;s just kindness .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
i had a relationship with that beauty for several months .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
we have all our navigation systems in our cars .
we want to eliminate mass arrests . &quot;
we see the same thing in the disabled movement .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
and so i made a little bit of an unusual decision .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a huge loss .
you know , it was a trick , right ?
emc presents &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
now we &apos;re doing this with drivers and machines .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
you do something a little bit different , actually .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
there is a connection , a respect to each other .
the people in the side rooms are coming in now .
i &apos;ll agree first , that &apos;s logical .
we wanted to develop a tool for language learners .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
and some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t work .
if you want to make it hyperlinks between the images .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and we want to get this to a global level .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right about ?
there &apos;s a program that some people may know .
so we &apos;re going out there , and where are we going ?
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
and i thought , let &apos;s bring the poker use right now .
they virtualize reality without computers .
the child in me is really excited about opportunities like this .
a little bit more about them than they are .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
and how did that work work for you ? what did it do ?
it seems important to me to unify both .
the dog ! i was loud in front of it .
now , do you know what the answer to this question is ?
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
when i say reality , i mean photoreality .
al is a hydrant in boston city .
but the phosphorus will not be replaced .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
right now we are far from that goal .
my mother suffered from the boat &apos;s nightmare .
the main problem here is kind of like aids .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
have a nice example of that .
and we &apos;re reinventing ourselves as often as we want .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the board staff anymore .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about reality .
and it was the same after the three months .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know he was here in 1835 .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities of that yet .
then i say , thank you very much , right ?
we are all born . we are bringing children to the world .
these results have been done through several weeks of hard work .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
why do i do that ? what comes out of this ? &quot;
probably one of those numbers has to get very close to zero .
... could you just just show the slide for a second ?
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and i said , &quot; yes , very much . &quot;
in the same way , i think we &apos;re entering games today .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the assistant doctor .
this player is about to stand in front of an epic victory .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i went over and just listened .
now , fortunately , there are a lot of studies as well now .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
it also shows up in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
this is how we learn trust and the rules of the game .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
imagine just two other small changes .
this is an idea worth spreading .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so , go ahead and start inventing them .
so please listen when a music is played .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
it &apos;s hard to overestimate the destruction .
and that &apos;s the message in n .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s going on .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
what we &apos;ve stayed with is the story walk .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke now , but it should be a joke .
do that once , and then you get the sentence .
we can continue these things in different examples .
we actually know that something else is the case .
these are promised and curious programs .
there are some places we can turn to .
because they have special skills of process accompanion .
i said , &quot; promising , oma . &quot;
go and quit leonard cohen .
that means that ants weigh a lot more than we do .
so here are some natural fireflies .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
the second factor is the services we use .
and we can look at that now .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is changing .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
but what this image says is a problem .
and that changed my way of making films completely .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
his whole work process has changed afterwards .
and if not , then stuxnet doesn &apos;t do anything .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
they moved to a natural concept .
look , let me give you an analogy .
we didn &apos;t have child paralysis in this country yesterday .
this is another look at the tree of life .
and we created an ipad app .
we called it the digital water of pavillion .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
you can look around all these museums here .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
think about it . this attack is generic .
and i took a while to figure this out .
loans and sponsors were searched .
how much money is needed to realize this ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
he says , &quot; get ready for jumping up . &quot;
so he got the citizens to check them .
we repeated that exercise with the same students .
&quot; look at your stomach , pink .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
so we start with a windows drone .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
imagine a soundless airplane .
i think that &apos;s true for every human on the planet .
every big picture is the beginning of a cut .
so these women met , and they just sat .
there is no overpopulation problem in trees .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
child mortality has declined by a tenth of a tenth .
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you !
we redesigned them , repaired them .
they teach them to open doors for themselves .
they had 348 different types of brand .
and i see the same process combining photographs .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
it grows in winter and shrink in summer .
you zoomed in . you can actually go in .
so in other words , i define first what i want .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
you can move inside and experience different kinds of experiences .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
when you have something to give , now give it .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website here .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
the only problem with this was she had 10 children .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
or are they more like a down attribute ?
this is the consequence we have to ask ourselves .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
it was seen almost 200 million times this year .
but these are all roads in the u.s.a .
are they eight ? and they &apos;re like 007 ?
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
he described one of them as very common .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
and at all , you worked much less than i did .
and less usable or usable it is .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
play is the tickle that keeps us together .
but volume is much bigger than ever before .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
everybody knew your genius was a little shy .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
you may have heard that we put in watermarks .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open your doors ?
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
so the occupythesec movement did it .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
and these were sort of the first of human beings developed toys .
we go to the poor of the placebo industry .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
maniok is something that eats half a billion people .
i will never play the way in this moment .
that &apos;s there , then that comes back .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
and do you know what my answer to all of these is ?
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
where is the biggest interest in actually doing this ?
the living self has no voice in that choice .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
we went back to the wreck of the titanic .
here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
we should put the bear in the cage .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
you get a model that emerges from all around the world .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned how to sing ?
the audience faces were very serious and alert .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation &apos;s fuels .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
because artists have a broken relationship with lies .
zidane , at a moment of the head .
and no , it &apos;s not wise man or san francisco .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
it &apos;s an ne form of refourth behavior , right ?
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
in one place , the screen fills with leaves .
every society is coined by a primary medium .
this year it was seen almost 50 million times .
how can i make something possible for use friendly ?
the grandfather of this old man refused to refuse .
also , the energy episode is very important for them .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
he steel every five thousand hope out of my mind .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s changing games !
we didn &apos;t have a word for what we started there .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this is an interactive trickfilming twist .
paralysis is a series of choices .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
and sal ol√© ! think of it despite all of this .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
i &apos;m still going to continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
well , we introduced the mayor belhole .
with pivot , they can dive in a decade .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
well , today we know all about where our things come from .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
also urban designers and construction engineers are very interested .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t restrict yourself .
bg : a breakthrough of energy is the most important .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
is it serving for others , or is it affecting us ?
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
and the film is called &quot; the maker &apos;s door ever . &quot;
now we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even streaming .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital hitting the physical .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
as i said , two-thousand-thought just started it .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
but i really believe that something else comes after us .
the biggest difference between them is the process of time .
how do you judge people based on their characteristics ?
i didn &apos;t know how to use the steam .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
it &apos;s actually going to be more like my goggles .
edward caastronova is a economist .
the cell communities again began to abstract information .
well , there aren &apos;t several thousand goals in this area .
and then we &apos;re offering one of these great dunes .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; get it wrong .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
we know another one where all the gas stations are .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m going to dissolve as well as what &apos;s in there .
i &apos;m going to execute it for you and then explain it .
you know nothing can do it in this goldfish glass . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
what other metamorphoes have you gone through ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
in both cases , they got surgery , and they were fine .
now , how do people die in the course of such a hack ?
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being intelligent .
it doesn &apos;t work that way for the remembering self at all .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
it says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
this is my meat , and i can flip it around .
so you just go to google nuclear project.com .
i sell snakes all over the country , all over the world .
the first story about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
a research mester on natural interface design .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my lap like this .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same .
i was absolutely obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
this is star night , probably never seen like this before .
when we start thinking about it this way , it changes everything .
in the course of this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
as a child , i kept drawing comic books and things like that .
i can &apos;t play the same as in 20 years today .
a manhattan project ? how do we get there ?
by the way , that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk .
both cases woke up at me , grabbed me .
so when klaus says there &apos;s no soul .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re aiming at now .
many of them talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
we were only flooding around the same way as we were .
that &apos;s why thinking about how to weigh it .
our steps in digitizing life were exponential .
... it gives it to crowdsourcing .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
so how does a man deal with certain things .
and of course , how does design affect perception .
that is , the crime rates go back .
it could happen within a time &apos;s learning framework .
she had suffered you with untreatable brain damage .
this is how he screamed and said , this is it ?
and yet , there &apos;s this mental intersection .
we have an abstract language .
i &apos;m here to share with you my photography .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
lawt : i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
another example is what we call virtual reality .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i know what people think when they see that .
as was happening before in the village .
but we don &apos;t know very little about where things are going .
there &apos;s more behind it . it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
they attached them to the respiratory machine .
all life &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
ok , imagine this as extreme self-motivation .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
ask , ask , ask for evidence , ask for light .
and yet , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
so this is what happens to this nanotape machine age .
it was the misguided cross against drugs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
it &apos;s slowing down for none of our big problems .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was even different .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
but actually , that night it was a more fun one .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
but they can combine something special like this .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
have you ever seen a clistetric tree ?
it was called the automatically connected stone .
what are you going to consume ? what are you praying ?
this was not a film , no hd , this was real .
it &apos;s new to america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
frosty , the carbon man gets cleaner every day .
i wasn &apos;t there very long ago with miguel .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
because the images really feel it for them .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
thylacine rat ? yes . alive ? yap .
diginotar is a certification site .
the idea is to overlift a digital security system .
we see the process that feeds itself .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
remember , and wum , you &apos;re in the museum .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
he took up a famous photo . what did it mean ?
diphump , tube , child paralysis ...
so i know of some who did not hire .
so we should be better off figuring out what the goal is .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
but what if you want to see the brush strike ?
we had to worry about lawyers and so forth .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
i was filming in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
so i step back for a second , and then i get the perspective .
so , in a certain sense , technology is overwhelming us .
that &apos;s a relatively substantial number of people around the world .
the brochumes still describe them as untouched .
she was a gun , strong woman , she had an impact .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the seasonal years .
because the musical instrument is the expansion of our body .
when we build cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
well , the energy episode has fallen over time .
they were asked to talk about their pain every 60 seconds .
it &apos;s like asking someone to hit the sun .
and then we did a lot of simulation .
this is a variant one of the things that was done .
and so it escapes its agonizing conditions .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
it &apos;s this kind of creepy , cost-effective taste .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
a baby needs about six thousand angles .
a few years ago , i started developing littalive .
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
open up the map , and jump with a click .
and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive decreases .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingculture .
what is this new state that is slowly accepting the world ?
imagine these images could really start to fly .
it caused enormous july in the control room .
he lived only for about 30 years .
in other words , play is our adaptation joker .
the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
in 25 years , it will have gone from here to here .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
and i can tell you it was a shifting experience .
ohhhhh , wowwwww !
and even today , we &apos;re still very , very strong in stories .
and i don &apos;t expect it to ever change .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
it &apos;s not just a nice soundscape .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
what we need are a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing real space .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prefer injustice .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
why do they advertise around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions we need to be facing .
let &apos;s call the animal beginner , it costs a lot of money .
we also brought littlive to design schools .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
if one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the movie of stats .
and as we get older , the wind gets bigger .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
50 percent of their decisions have been made in nine minutes or less .
i mean , how much do we consume from our memories ?
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
this is the time you fall in love .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
in fact , we are also such a large-scale community .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
secondly , combined photos should have the same species of lighting .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
and we &apos;re replacing the oil with other energy carriers .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of it .
and also , what you would think of today in mind .
but can you do that if you go to an foreign ?
and the film will be called &quot; the door door ever . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
and then immediately i come up with it , which is unfair .
i hope you &apos;ll look forward to that . thank you very much .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
blaise , this is really incredible . thank you very lucky wish .
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight this ?
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through masses , 20 per hour .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i &apos;m not making it .
so there should be a nine of them at the beginning of my death .
and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize .
because they are the people who are also experts in taste .
but it turns out that this isn &apos;t all yet .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was nodding .
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
just that i think i like it more , right ?
for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
there are a series of photographs somewhere here -- here they are .
well , your living self is not going to get happier .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of sea level , just like greenland .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding her this morning , &quot; he said .
since that time , we &apos;ve gotten all sorts of recognition .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 if a bat hits 300 .
that all of our survival is linked to the survival of each individual .
this is the audience we just finished recently .
so the smarter the gut better the system . &quot;
we &apos;ve moved before in the so-called avian age .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
and they light the way through the rest of the book .
this approach is true of everything we do creatively .
the more money you earn is happier .
in 2010 , we had just joined together among two billion people online .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
he &apos;s got a 15 to one .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
they interact with their surroundings and their experiences in a clear way .
you know , there were no mandarin in paradise .
and this video had actually been sent in january .
even if you kill someone , it &apos;s not just a murderer .
i studied woman printer , and she was in breathing .
and i was collecting more and more knowledge all the time .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
i now know it was the cause of the sea .
i can say the chancer is a man .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
and this was the first time i learned this .
this trick you can introduce to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
and the next interesting period took about another billion years .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
and all of a sudden , he no longer seemed human .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to get more efficient .
each of these topics , of course , was made up of many , many smaller decisions .
and immediately i see another pattern that arises .
a few months went on , and i had just forgotten everything .
we &apos;ve spent three years now in holland .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
so that got me right , and i wanted more .
the fact is that that uncertainty should care us .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
yes , this is a picture of a burden down there .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little child .
obviously , this is not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
my great-grandparents all died when they were 60 .
or do you want to be fitter , stronger , have more power ?
an amazing error rate . one in nine innocent .
and i don &apos;t just mean less success , even though that &apos;s part of it .
players are champions of social networking spiders .
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
so in the west , people have really spent a long time thinking about creativity .
one consequence of that was that the phone had never broken .
and of course , it can &apos;t exist in germany anymore . &quot;
so from the same bad team , one of them became the best .
b has these benefits and these risks . what do you want to do ?
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are possibilities everywhere
it was a store called the kieter .
the things that are only being used are going into technical systems .
they did that by imposing the land .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire department .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
please welcome the fear . please welcome the risk .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
that &apos;s like all of you in the pre-wind period .
in there they are , they want to go to the end of the gang .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a rolling iceberg .
that &apos;s somebody who , by the way , meets four out of 10 .
we &apos;ve been used to things linear happen .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as mandatory .
and then people could eat it and they wouldn &apos;t get blind .
i want to present to you two , maybe three examples as well .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
so the device that you see has not worked .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of information overload .
i apologize that i have to cut so much .
this is already loses half of his value in the first year .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned assembly language .
then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with them .
so , if you can turn that light back on , please .
are they there ? they look a little nervous .
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
there &apos;s a direct reference system for this .
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
and i think it helps the world look like this .
and what &apos;s noticed is that i needed an expert .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
i sent her home without talking to my upper doctor .
we need to rely on the machinery of government .
well , how do you begin to speak the language of music ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
the creation of software usually takes a few years .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is vision .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and i convinced her to fund an expedition .
again , what potential do we want to call ?
i &apos;ll tell you what those notes might have to mean .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is something truly fantastic .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
when it wasn &apos;t moving , they were buried .
because all these new technologies of today feed themselves .
because this is where the actual government work is taking place .
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with you .
the cost of solar was down 50 percent last year .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
the previous example was about finding detail .
some people were disappointed it was not poetry .
secondly , what economists call oppersia cost .
it has moments of life , one after another .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a special thing . &quot;
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach that .
that &apos;s why you help with it , ask people about it .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
do you know how many decisions do you make in a typical week ?
a typical walmart now offers you 100,000 products .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i knew she &apos;d come to goodbye .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even good .
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask .
so they &apos;re moving around making art installations like this .
and other examples are the ambitious , intelligent systems .
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job right .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
i went through the emergency department on my way home .
&quot; 2.5 to one what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
i was shocked , and i was shocked to the inside .
and then we started negotiating with the insulin landers .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
which one would you like to have if it could only have one ?
anyone heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
but also , our sense of self , however , is disappointing us .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
when we looked at how feelings vary with income .
how many doors does the house that you live in ?
and i guess many of you have done that too .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
but so far , i &apos;m just going to do it a little bit curious .
there &apos;s a step-step guidance there .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
we &apos;ll be faced a few more days in the next few days .
this first one , this was more like a passionate monkey .
i was no longer arguing with my wife for two years .
well , the memory self is a storyteller .
most of my activities , i have two hips .
that keeps us there , and allows us to evolve .
you see the person inside of it wondering what &apos;s going on .
it was the fear of terror that formed their lives .
and it &apos;s especially the first time to ask what &apos;s the right thing to do .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
the words , as long as his friends , now spoken to his .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he deceived her .
make it impossible to tell how the photo was actually put together .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
because the music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
we think about our future as predicted memories .
and we found that , in fact , there was a connection .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
i started thinking , i should just get into the project .
you add a blue one to a green one , and you can make light .
the pilot was making the machine out after the hudson river .
but they don &apos;t notice the previous losses .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
do you know how much decisions do you make on a typical day ?
so the driving force behind this is cyber superpower .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on themselves .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if you don &apos;t do that , anybody can take it away .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
sometimes i lose balance . a story finally .
so now we &apos;ve removed the time scales .
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
am i looking like i could just write a song ?
because through marine protected areas , we basically restore the past .
these images are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos islands .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
we know money is very important , targets are very important .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
grow up a fish , but also a bird reserve .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum of a lot of ideas .
most of them are completely ignored by the memory themselves .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
has one single person in the audience ever seen anyone die of masses ?
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
i want to end with a story that really got me excited .
and online criminals &apos; motives are very easy to understand .
it raises the question whether you can get that to zero .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we can look at the garbage problem , of course .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to face .
so , for example , shake the environment , drive less car .
so nowadays , evolution can happen in time from microseconds .
so the question is , how do we deal with these winds ?
just to precise time points , you &apos;re agreed .
you can test it after my talk in your rooms .
that &apos;s where we have cases like diginotar .
so when i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s what worries your interest .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
that too , so in any store , you can get things back .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
she said it would be like a thundering train of air .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
think of this as a score , as a flying score .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
usually most people start to orient themselves about the task .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
you have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car .
the most powerful miner worker is the head of massey coal .
this is a fascinating adventure to go on .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the living itself .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t go that way .
it &apos;s almost as if we prepare for our lives .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our heads .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
this is a whole book , an example of non-image data .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death penalty .
i became the miracle part of not to die that day .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many outfits ?
let &apos;s call it miguel . it &apos;s actually called miguel .
if you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
if we exaggerate it , we can handle a little back .
we all need to believe at the end things we can &apos;t see .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
they don &apos;t even come out of the museums , i think .
and as a general notion , we can use the word &quot; intersexuality . &quot;
tempt will be part of the show , which has really gone off .
and i thought that was so difficult , so painful .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
here he &apos;s highlighting a rare equilibrium .
and then the same thing happens in a good , appropriate conversation .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation needs .
we record images of this mini-big bang in detectors .
car color , outside of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can do that .
economists call this a pareto improvement assessment .
because he doesn &apos;t know which pile he &apos;s supposed to go first to .
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
they now have a five-percent renewable energy percentage .
so the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
you feel that &apos;s the real truth behind the outcome .
this is technology supported innovation that we have today .
and if you do , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma again in new york .
but while they were talking to different people in the world about these possibilities .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple exercise .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
that means we &apos;re useful , we &apos;re not less harmful about it .
we produce androgen , and we respond to androgens .
and perhaps the best part is what we want in health .
wr wants to help people who were innocent .
bonobos are our closest living relatives with chimpanzees .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
you go around the block , and you take it as an epiphany .
ceos are a little bit about average , but this is where it gets interesting .
the judge considers him as an adult , but i see a child .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little they get supported .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the tempts room .
now he &apos;s mentioning the minerals needs of phytoplankton .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
the first of these fall is an inconsistency to admit complexity .
they invest a lot of their time in the assembly of ever-growing structures .
but i don &apos;t know how people will be peaceful .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
usually you &apos;re kind of just wrong , and some people don &apos;t .
i want to give you a particular aspect of curiosity .
this is evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
six : social decline . seven : 65 .
from my point of view , i looked up and down at the janitor .
that means that the player is definitely beating three out of 10 .
a long time ago there were gray whales there -- 500 years ago .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece is comparable to that .
many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
fireflies in a jar , i always found quite exciting .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me like this .
so when i was 15 , i decided to be a diver .
here i give it a little bigger . we &apos;re looking at the center right here .
and i really want to show you my outfits this week .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points of imagery , i think .
and that &apos;s also what i had last half-year .
but instead of getting to panic , he just stopped .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
it was always so inspiring , so daunting .
turned the garbage pitch on the side . went home .
i like things that are curious . i like weird things .
but somehow we &apos;re able to get away from this problem .
and guess what we found in the fine code ?
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
if you look at the people you have to deal with ...
okay , let me squeeze some blood out for you .
what about the contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
imagine that every single person is being controlled .
and they did it with something called lead-maps .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
we degrade a person who has value for our society .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come to court .
well , in fact , the number of violent crime has not changed very much .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
it means that we have a cultural impact on the scientific side .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
so you might want to put a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
i first eaten him in a restaurant in southern spain .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity , on our humanity .
so i &apos;ve been looking at this , when is of course or intuitive ?
here &apos;s an excerpt from this fine code .
and these are just the biohackers now , the individual people .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
we strapped his bed so he can look outside .
they were the biggest scared of pirates , rape and death .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
that &apos;s actually only really only imagined two thousand really , these networks .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
but a lot of people get caught up in a very strange position .
so this looks like a basketball playoff .
someone had broken down , and had hacked the system really thorough .
just this airport has a space of 100 square kilometers .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely autonomous .
we hire games to escape the suffering of the real world .
from that time , an anecdote that you may know .
our gut is a wonderfully hostile environment for these bacteria .
that goes far further back into pre-industrial times cultures .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get out of all these extensions .
and six million seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
there was the core research facility of leopoldshaven .
i grew up with a higher portion of science fiction .
pictures like this : a construction site along a much richer road .
well , the two types of self toss two concepts of happiness .
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in researchers in happiness .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
so i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
well , the living self lives continuously .
i brought with me seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
i think somehow six dollars or something like that .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
well , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landroad .
an eighth , mixed brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
so finally , here was a company that was trying to do it right .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
is it just as clear that the answer to the question is , you .
so a few years ago , i set out to do exactly that .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
so find programs that can make up most likely numbers .
how can a judge turn someone into something that he &apos;s not ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building longer , not intense .
the composer is becoming more and more to the friend you live with .
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the minerals .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can take a little trip .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they increase paralysis , and they lower happiness .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
and i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re really going to stay there .
a few -- probably about as many creative people here .
what about a sentence of new never heard before ?
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
basically , the concrete building block had become the building block of our time .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect in hollywood .
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a glacier flight .
possibilities that had not been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limitations .
this is , in fact , the real melting of man and machine .
there was , i think , a pretty good code there .
finally , when we move forward , we should welcome fear .
why is it important to start ? what is the red ?
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s back 2,500 years .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
and if they &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
i ask , how technically competent was this diagnosis ?
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
ah , the majority . i like to think of that as a doctor .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
the noises have the function of the letters of a script .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
it &apos;s renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
i looked in the rail , and it was a little bit of pink .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again so far .
what is that related to the thoughts and feelings about them ?
54 percent of the deaths went through drilling .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is my wlan-scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this is a fish rising in the southwestern corner of spain .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
and then we worked out this kind of a code-free ct .
that &apos;s why the dramatic high numbers come to the prisoners .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
then these are abandoned influences of pre-industrial culture .
some of my sounds happened in the last five years .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular pitch .
that means you navigated about sound and about rhythm .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize on software for the winners .
and so i think the ted community should be bravers .
and soon after that , i wrote an article on genetically modified food .
and i had to explain to the journalists that this test doesn &apos;t exist .
these people will be connected to the movie in eternity -- forever .
most people know this from the software field .
this actually includes just a two-and-a-half weeks period .
and the key indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
when someone lies , they &apos;re not just a liar .
do you know what you call a 3,000 in major league baseball ?
and this is called androgenic defect .
even if you shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
we &apos;re evolving to collaborative thinking , heart creatures .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
you learn how to find the notes on the instrument .
right now it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
well , finally , the film has taken a very big momentum .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism in our culture .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
we find other oddities of what your rights are .
there was no piano yet as an instrument .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and it &apos;s spread tirelessly , organic , of course .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
i think in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it out .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a ph.d. student .
it &apos;s our new home country called nunavut .
my friends in hduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
by the end of march , the lhc will be operable again .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
if we actually don &apos;t take up a phosphorus and abandon it .
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after another .
if they could do it for those , they certainly could help me as well .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about that , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
he said , &quot; bezos , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
and when i listened to her , she made sooking noises .
it &apos;s about making goods flow out of scarce .
that &apos;s the time that most perceptions we have .
and somehow we have to create changes that go to zero .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never met each other as adults .
this is our youngest beta-test down there on the bottom right .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
and i was good , i graduated with cum laude .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
according and quiet signs , f and b , et cetera .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights as a human being .
on september 10 last year , the machine ran on the first time .
what were its circumstances , like society and politics ?
i like lots of black colors , lots of gray sounds and stuff like that .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
the human is supposed to come from the monkey or have a common ancestor .
we &apos;ve distributed license to children , and you see them playing with it .
i played the first sentence by beethoven violin .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
specialized skills and processes and their combinations lead to success .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded per minute .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inconvenient .
so interplay enables you to grow from ties , trust and with each other .
people said , &quot; how come you &apos;re not afraid of never succeeding ?
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
i got in the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to actually do the experiments .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make her very , very tired . &quot;
in my opinion , mass instructions have fundamentally changed our world .
i love this one : &quot; watson is forcing human opponents . &quot;
this is all reality today , and in the future , much more will be possible .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a kind of impulse for the flyfire .
here it says , the more you move , the better .
and this is something we need to learn very quickly .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
three months later , i had moved around , and the adventure went on .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
so unfortunately , we have god &apos;s way of virtualizing a piece far away .
we live on a planet covering 70 percent of the water .
just swap out the building of apartments against cities .
this is naturally coming from asia , in the case of japan .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear power facilities .
and i tend to think of humility as my shadow .
these are just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
often the music class is true that you only learn the grades .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
because lying in such a way that you can just use this logic wrong .
&quot; do you remember the patients you sent home ? &quot;
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
eight : tsunami warning . nine : cyberattacks .
bruno guissani : mark , come back .
now there &apos;s all this rumble before the great unveiling .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be little bit bad .
just when it seems hardly appropriate , play is perhaps the most necessary .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
what you need is an environment that puts you in a position .
you collect information about the play in the secondary literature .
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how are we going to get there ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
official beliefs of all western industrialized societies .
so that was the very first start of your own musical expression .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
there were a lot of studies conducted to see if that was true .
you can only have nullemissions if you &apos;re not there .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and then you can see the enormous speed possibilities there .
but what if the image connected them to all of their images ?

this is because the government is like a further ocean , and these are the top 15 centimeters of politics .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did before .
now what about virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the navy , you &apos;ll notice that too , and you can get a little nervous .
and the color notes and the shades may remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
imagine if in front of the screen could just appear in different formats or bigger , in different solutions .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this has been mentioned so often .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to make these games within us .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
they do this because they can follow the striped white line of a92 .
when you turn on the light , it looks like this . so the same way we &apos;ve seen it before .
that can , in our case , be that we use it to design and create a symbol .
when paul speaks in a public audience , he can &apos;t say without armed guards .
but in order to be part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice through congress .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten the forests of flour .
at the end of one day , i was cooking a giant tank soup that we shared .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
while we &apos;re falling off , i had this feeling of dying human beings is not terrifying .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have body types challenging social norms .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is we started to abstract .
they help with the digestive of nutritional nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not steians special breeding meat .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to really devastating this world .
that will , i think , be part of the national statistic in the next decade or two .
if dan were a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes cabrio .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + one strength &quot; or &quot; + one intelligence . &quot;
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than it is now that it is less .
what would you do that you shoot up because you think you were there forever ?
in a sense , the arctic ice caps is the beating heart of our global climate system .
we just wanted to know what was going on with a normal , breathing electrochemical battery .
but the more i thought about it , the more i thought the fish knew something .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotated stuff , like maniook .
a tv or a washing machine , because they only use it , they don &apos;t use it .
for us and it &apos;s game fundamental for connecting relationships and the nurturing of tolerance .
one is the energy density these technologies generate dramatically lower than the power plants .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but these articles made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and i finally figured it out .
these are our master players . 500 million people , who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
now you might think that the whole collapse of categories would really make someone happy like me .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantum mechanical superposition .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not made up of teeth and claws alone .
when these imagery drops down , you can write on it , you can display patterns , images , text .
our cities have been eradicated , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it &apos;s got a meaning and strength that it otherwise doesn &apos;t have .
you might think this is just a landscape picture , and the lower part has been manipulated .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper almost every day , which is what you find in that third sentence .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishing cold and tentious to ourselves who can afford it .
i believe that somehow you &apos;ve moved to nostalgia to wonder .
i thought , &quot; make the camera out , &quot; that would mean that we wanted to have a conversation behind it .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s only that architecture almost disappears .
if you put an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to get a pound of sugar tuna .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve changed the order to represent this information .
so for example , the number 164 is very sticking out of this code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
bill big has several companies , including one called esolar , who has great solar thermal technologies .
or are we sure to be something else -- something that may actually be better adapted to the environment ?
that was our first attempt , starting with digital information , the genomic phi x 174 .
and the preparations for this were enormous . we had to build cameras and headlights and all kinds of things .
and as part of that , they made us a concept that was about anatomical similarities .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
just to give you an overview , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
we got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as we used to .
and the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in three generations who together build a new life .
they don &apos;t fight the battle we all fight , so they &apos;re allowed to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
you have to make the sound of the wind , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
this is an example from a very different area . monet painted the seaerose x-times .
and i would like to give to protocols that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but do you know what ?
i really hope that we play together important games to survive another century on this planet .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pitch of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
because obviously , an animal that was very common gets rarely before it dies .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly corrosive , but they &apos;re unaffordable .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice as to show this slide .
the next piece of the puzzle is how a boat is going on in the early morning in the red in lake .
you just can &apos;t emphasize enough of how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being &apos;s life .
by shaking the sidelines and putting them next to each other , he can let the characters interact ...
and the sidewalks are androgens , which are viristic hormones .
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are master players .
players love to become part of the awe of distant missions of planetary order .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
i thought it would be like holding us our fancy clocks and dreaming cameras .
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
i was the second volunteer at the security station , so i had a pretty good opportunity to be able to do .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s phosphorus activity .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send her home , and there probably weren &apos;t a man in her treatment .
in china today , a neighbor today is called a honeybean potter , as it were , right ?
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
already today in some flat lakes in alaska methane from even out of the water .
michael j. nelson of the mystery science theater was the first to make a joke on twitter about it .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so , probably or evil aquaculture , fisheries , will be part of our future .
furthermore , despite their logarithmic course on the left , it &apos;s walking upward .
so in order for us to understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you an elementary , very simple magic trick .
both are strong subfusions , because we don &apos;t really look at the problem as much as we should .
either flute fusion or a paradise winds , you &apos;re going to have the choice .
so , in the sense of shifting the evidence load , you &apos;re seeing the brilliance of the lie .
as a child , i had collections of stickers , rocks , gies and claws .
and this is how you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
the other day they read her to go -- woman printer , woman , mother and grandmother .
one of the things about these archaic models is that we have a principle natural relationship with virtuality .
for them , life had made a task : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most commonly supported children &apos;s book .
here &apos;s what it takes to recover what we understand under polite correctness .
we need to stop people from understanding things , especially when they &apos;re true .
and that &apos;s half the world &apos;s underwater problems that are caused by the textile industry .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really blew me out of the socks .
this is almost confined with complete security -- perhaps also for the fish , definitely for us .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so we can anticipate development .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , of ease , of delivery .
in this country , for children , there are life-long sentencing sentencing without conditional punishment .
that i only do it differently and more beautiful doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better handable .
his mother was locked in being a punishment for -- for being wealthy for crime .
now , reproduce all the remaining remains that the numbers have best reproduced .
and she somehow managed to find time to soak up english and it-qualification .
two : famine in somalia . three speakers : pfefferspray of police .
this sounds very spacing , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european .
and i think the most important thing about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
maybe return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creativity .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
why not have the fast muscles that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
so maybe we sell a shoe , and it becomes the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
do the methods that are easy to use and start hugging patients on the team .
i brought one example with you from the nootka-indians north american tribe .
the idea here , obviously , is not just overlists the machine operators in the control room .
we now have almost an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the mobile phone world .
so we could take the world very easily with stupid ones , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
we know that we work as human beings optimal when we do hard , meaningful work .
well , we know from that study that you have to reach the needle if it &apos;s about to do it .
we say , &quot; computers , please generate a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
this gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
now , when i was a neuling in college , i had my first biology classes .
and so from interested in this technology , i &apos;ve just gone on to this .
i &apos;m going to refer to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard of before .
and like a lot of people , i thought the government was mainly about choosing people into an office .
and so by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since he , as i have to say , has been very successful introduction .
a third sentence that immediately comes up in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
and we may first know which wood we &apos;ve carved out of when we &apos;re really being tested .
this is called gestalt law , or just gestalt psychology , which , again , affects us in perception .
so there are all the tools available , and the only thing that lifts us is our imagination .
once in high school , one student said that brian goldmann would learn for a blood test .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the tempo in one direction or the other .
so when we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to embrace virtuality as a real habitat .
if someone asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be like ?
this question was so dazzling that we decided to explore the answer and developed sidelines .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re looking at next to the actual existence as a stakeholder .
so basically , what i &apos;m worried about is , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you make it possible .
for example , we &apos;ve developed an icon package , which is liquid at room temperature .
you don &apos;t sit around and you spin . there &apos;s always something important to do .
well , you see , in all cases , no one has to be an exquisite candidate .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
police officers came in and dedicated state lawyers and offices .
this reference will propose to invest money in more security agencies and security .
this is sort of the deadline that has shown us the environmental models that we need to hold .
unfortunately they &apos;re not in openbach , but maybe they can help the fryer a little bit .
most of the mass inmates in this country did not actually happen in the class of violent crime .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have a few downsides .
so to me , photography seemed more like going to the right place at the right time .
do you say that there are negative effects that are dealing with the clouds that are shifting things ?
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the human ancestry .
that &apos;s why a lot of people also come in and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
and that sadness really evolved in a thought , which is that i wish only one thing .
when i went back there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half its size .
now , morgan , on behalf of transparency , this is what happened to the $ 7100 ?
and also , a recent study was done by ceos , where they watched the ceos for a week .
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow people liked that .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
for the creators , they usually have the first semester , the great rock laws .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed this point in choosing our collective good .
i &apos;m assure they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often called a &quot; passenger wave reactor . &quot;
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your neighbors &apos; cells ?
because , first of all , in this context , we &apos;re beginning to understand the truly amazing things that are happening to us .
this also represents the entertainment value of this talk , so i hope you enjoy it .
nothing moves into my sleeve or comes out , no trickiness . and you can study everything .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly smart individual .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics , who made me crazy , were not fanatics at all .
but actually , my research at the institute of the future is precisely the opposite .
i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to court and do this crazy case .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that maybe our species has been around for 600,000 years .
unfortunately , this is all the good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned frequently .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got to face only two years later when we moved to california .
if i put myself in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
it &apos;s almost impossible physiologically impossible to be miserable when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
so we have the memory itself and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the viral particles were then released from the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
so we had to develop a new method where we could put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing its lifestyle .
and this really determines these ideas to deploy these limitations for place on the screen .
are we using these decisions to shape a society which is better , which is more successful , which is more friendly ?
i got another gift , which is to look into the future and come back and live different .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
here we see this again again , again , again , again , this is all the individual aggregate .
so doing things like this -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor guy that seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
evolution is all about the next generation , adaptation and survival after generation .
if you surround with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it .
so in other words , the future has shrunk by a year since i &apos;ve been in the world .
so you need to have music language learning , at least as long as it is for spoken language .
and we &apos;re going to install an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond area .
we &apos;ve managed to get about a hundred genes out of the 500 or something that are here .
people are shaking themselves in their faith , so tightly you can &apos;t free them .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- except for my physiotherapy .
because people often come , they can &apos;t use it in a way that anybody can deal with it .
so we overlists our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t accept it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
well , just to conclude , i want to realize that i talked a lot about the fathers .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have only threatened before one generation , barely yet .
the greeks called these divinous divinity spirits of creativity , moonies .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of the numbers .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it go into the next century .
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; we are running out of oil . &quot;
who knows when the movie comes out , maybe we look like a horror vollididate .
when we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them by a few nucleotides ?
now , it sounds very banal for the first time , but it &apos;s quite exciting when you think about it .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and longevity .
if you break down the goldfish glass so everything is possible , you lower happiness .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of a mixture of scrabble and boggled .
they shut up the decision -- they shut up , even when it comes to their own best interests .
regardless : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , so i can zoom back out , zoom in .
because if we could figure that out , we would have sort of never given that much human potential before .
i guess i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
it would have been without the environmental requirement , but it makes it so much more important .
as peter told us , not only do they produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
we hope that that &apos;s no longer pop-ups and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self , at the end you &apos;re going to do very different things .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a tape recorder .
man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the hurricane .
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer that immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen here , and it &apos;s happening right now .
and in order to win , the device has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
certainly , i would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
they played a cube , and the siders were allowed to break into an epic adventure .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on the planet .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success of the scientific method .
the founding fathers , from my point of view , were the original anatomical activists , and that &apos;s why .
there &apos;s actually a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about , where the wireless plan works .
the human part of that bay , way at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
the first example predicts what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
but there &apos;s no way that we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
his cause to write the play will become more and more of my personal cause to play it .
and the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
but these concepts of cyberage that bring us these possibilities back to rediscover our capabilities .
so these tendencies to survive longer , and they multiplied at greater extent .
and that &apos;s just how words emerge , which we use over and over again in the language of the political correct speech .
immediately , they will experience one for which , of course , there are these forecasts , which you can &apos;t prove .
i want to explain to you today or approach something with this mechanism , which is unconsciously familiar with you .
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but here &apos;s the thing : if you get evidence , you have to adopt this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
in openbach , for example , 20 percent of the garbage waste is now winding .
but every once in a while , very rarely , something special happened , and one of the performers actually became overwhelming .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could make a , or we could make b .
my heart raced , i was dizzy while i was trying to grasp what was in front of me .
so i &apos;m now in front of one of my favorite images , tar breugel harvest workers .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with deceiving yourself .
what &apos;s happening is the machine age , and what &apos;s happening is the book , and what &apos;s happening is the photo-tography .
so , imagine you were in a number of places at the same time , how would that feel ?
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , which i &apos;ve been using a lot recently is evolution itself .
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus ; it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
so the neurons are the information processing system that these cell communities have built .
so , we were able to relate the little digital warheads to the rotor control .
at the moment , it was as if a film director had demanded a shift in the film .
and it &apos;s about solving a problem in a playful , creative , original way .
this is the way i would say goodbye to your child , it only strikes three times rather than five times .
echinacea , a little antioxidantic that will help you on the leaps .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first fuel of the fourth generation , which in about 18 months .
when professors get curious , they often get sneaked into n research semester .
i was talking to the oil industry recently , and they said that they were just going to flourish this model .
it turns out it actually meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your movie . &quot;
we had a team of fellows in boston last year that had the code for america &apos;s program .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
so that , as citizens , you &apos;re empowered to deal with these scientific technologies .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you take a piece of the future out there ?
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to get a realistic result .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have determined what the goal is .
it &apos;s about how happy or enjoying that person is when that person is thinking about their lives .
so the idea is that we actually involve the people in which they put things together , collectively .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you dropped it somewhere .
because the floor is going to die , and the wind is going to wash away , and the water is going to wash away .
you can go out and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can create your own collection .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they really produce drunkable shapes .
there are as controversial things as these whole genetically modified plants on the drivers .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break down into 20 parts as you know it from documentaries .
for these non-engineers , littlifetime became another material , electronics just became another material .
they &apos;ve reformed the world &apos;s demographics in a way that no war has ever done .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is indish , but also very time-consuming .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , productive members of the human community bring us ?
i met mr ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in which walt disney &apos;s hall hall .
i spent a lot of my life trying to be myself and adapt to me at the same time .
and yet , my interest in photography began when i received my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really need to go back in circles .
but not only that -- so they merge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
and the result is that , no matter where i come , i &apos;m treated as if i were refused to the demise .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process starts when the trigger is pressed .
and every time it divided , the chemicals in it have spread to vast amounts of chemicals .
if anyone had built a two-inch construction , they would have contributed the price back home .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken in by the mind . how can you be hurt ?
now , in holland , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in holland , you know , the country is built on flowers .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
the challenge provides a shared experience , a shared language , a basic preservation , to build the right prototype .
perhaps that &apos;s exactly what the sense of efficacy , a sense of self , is a sense of our own power .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new level of existence .
well , i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
if we can do that , then this current data trap will become , maybe a new source of meaningful information .
and you &apos;re going to offer them all the nutrients that they could only want without any effort on their part .
they found an article that was wrong with thought , and they could find the creator of that thought .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six that have stable structures .
this is really important , because this is an insight that is not in a single wikipediatrician .
i tried to make it clear how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than what they cost .
they live in a world that has abundance information and communication , as nobody could have predicted .
so people who think evolution is going to change as a gene at a time , have missed a lot from biology .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve captured with what &apos;s called the gigapixel technology .
our language connotes the social changes that have been caused in many cases by a technological change .
there are very , very few things you can even say , there &apos;s an opportunity in a million of them .
and i noticed how much these deep-sea events looked like a space mission .
so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
we made small pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
that was the movement . it was the justification . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
but i regret to be , but i &apos;m best able to learn from that to give it away to others .
i know we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now .
icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier , or by breaking out of ice sheets .
today we want to talk about how videos become viral , and then finally , why this is important at all .
but danny , throughout america &apos;s pursuit , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
and even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard because it pushes people together very quickly .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little bit of an explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
no one ever makes a mistake , but nobody is concerned about the details of how to do this .

if your work was brilliant you didn &apos;t boil everything for you , everybody knew you had this botherless genius that helped you .
his job is to create the conditions which existed less than a billionth of a second after the universe -- up to 600 million times within a second .
and a lot of the discussions i &apos;ve had over the last six years have been kind of like the discussion i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years on photovoltaics .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult , she turned to a box full of ashes and was put into my hands .
finally , this older black man came to the court with a very concerned facial expression and sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
there are a number of people who have much more uh-oh moments than others , and among the worst are fresh bwl graduates .
a juice pender , if you make the full of water , it has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s something like 40 to six thousand years old .
the reason that i was worse , with all these possibilities available , my expectations for what a few good jeans looked like , went up .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on the planet ; i &apos;m talking about creating a life of possibilities .
we want the world of creators , the inventors , the contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
the head of congress came onstage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
how to increase happiness is very different from how they think and whether they think about the memory themselves or whether they think about the living self .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we &apos;re going to be able to collect first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , nudelparties and nights , tony drew back after seven years .
so i was back there with a small team on unknown terrain , and we turned &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that had not existed before .
and then we don &apos;t have that , but that &apos;s just , i think , quite well underwent , people are quite convinced of this .
so for example , an organism could learn not to eat a particular fruit because it was bad and it was sick the last time he ate it .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health staff .
i mean , it can sound odd to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea ; they developed it .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but as we go up into the time machine , and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have done that .
so one day i decided to visit the filium jet , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work to offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and sometimes a little prototype of that experience is all it takes to take us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a ta-da moment .
but the knife kind of pushed back , and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not yet able to do that .
i was seventy-10 when i went back to one of his classes , and i played the last of the four ballot of chopin , a late piece .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you speak like this . &quot;
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which many of my colleagues say but is total nonsense .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we are not just consumers , and we are not just consumers of government paying and receiving taxes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
but this is keeping me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as badly as we do now , never before .
according to burrelle , the premier was in january , and since then -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , building the coal plant because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gastorage , because it can &apos;t be done .
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do this , and that we came back and all the images on the walls would be dedicated to graffiti .
but latest dna evidence shows that the etrusers who later formed the roman empire show the same dna as the old lydians .
it seems that we are quite remote from the other parts of life , but most of the construction of life , in fact , is quite the fundamental mechanisms of our cells .
well , there are mixed brands and eight brands , these things that come and go , but a mixed , eight brand is a pretty strong thing .
it &apos;s a very happy concert over and over again , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve worked as long as i have in advance as i have seen new experiences .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as though the first sentence of earlier was wrong , as though , of course , you had to take the opposite with no evidence .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive grocery store , at least at the time he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been elected a huge crisis in congress for this change in congress , at 124 , was elected to a voice .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it in for 60 years -- think of a pillar -- think of it as bury it without all the complexity .
so what these reactors was a problem , what we put in our fills , and therefore the volume of waste is dramatically reduced during this process .
and every year we ask the students to create business , products and services that can contain the lives of billions of people in a decade .
i love to be able to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , wearing , and also blogging recently too .
and something interesting happened here , because what fascinated me about jacques cousteout &apos;s shows was the idea of a completely unknown world on our earth itself .
one process that -- as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- in other words , everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always feel reasonable .
i came to ted because i think a lot of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is moving a long way out , but it &apos;s increasing justice .
i think molecular biology generally now , which is , generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you add to it , synthetic biology and so on .
they didn &apos;t matter because he had remained with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had received to keep it .
and our european network is basically only made up of loud rotating masses of big power plants , wherever the wave is all about europe .
and finally , saturday : a unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word about you .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of eliminating the risks that others create when they &apos;re just laying fire .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral rigation uses the words because , let &apos;s try to replace it by the words , though .
how about giving a voice to the oppressed wherever you are to take care of yourself and create change for the first time ?
so we &apos;re not only responsible for preserving the people we love from fate sleeps , but we also prepare them to prepare them to get good with it .
and it turns out that when you make it feel concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , we turn it into sound , we create something very complicated in the heads of others .
well , in egypt , the insurgency in april 2011 plundered the headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of acts .
we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book as kids , we took the description of the author and we projected it on the canvas in our heads .

and if you &apos;ve already gotten along that the droplet of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science itself .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan it to find the different places for the puzzle .
we got to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email saying nathaniel was interested in infant education .
so these are just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
and i tried to negotiate with me that if i double my efforts to perfection and never again made a mistake that the voice could hurt .
but it turns out also , because it turns out that by using play all this time , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re capable of as human beings .
i can today bring the noises that the stream has had to sound on the modern wing , which a barockes cembalo can &apos;t do .
even from the german to the english language , you can ask more knowledge , including when you &apos;re talking about poetry or even about poetry .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the strongest psychoactive preparat from the repertoire of shame .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be creating a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there may be massive new species of artification based on this digital design .
let &apos;s go back to my medical world where i feel a lot better or maybe a little less good after i spoke to you about it .
at this point , and if you laugh , you can see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can share very well with us .
basically , you get every round on every sible randomly assigned letter , and as you try to make words , they get tested by a dictionary .
one of the areas in which we see this in our culture today , in the united states today , are the battles of the beginning and the end of life .
but then another very interesting step happened , where things got completely different , which is that they started communicating and sharing information , so that communities came from cells .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , on climate .
we now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re hard at the media campus , for example , to show the virtual reality in our v.r.r lab , where we can actually do that all the time .
they &apos;re staring out at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is curved canals and these dense , lousy march .
and because the government ultimately exhausts its power -- he remembers , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in our future , is that we have more power today than individuals to address the big challenges of our planet .
what that means is that if you were to meet someone , and you were to tell them , oh , your father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about its size ?
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it spread from rare , is kind of a shame before the bug was on the institution of the government .
because it makes just as much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard about when it comes to explaining the absolute insane of the creative process .
so now it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever committed -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected connections that we form are really the bottom of creativity .
and if we succeed , of course , we can do it for obesity , for henry and mauritz and all the textile industry .
i got a ticket because i didn &apos;t drive on the bike , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t have to drive you all the time on the bike path .
and since there was no video games or this disclosure with computer-generated movies or all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good fraction of logic to bring together the complex ideas .
every step we made these pieces in the overload so we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never could have imagined before .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in &quot; i have a dream of speech , &quot; a kind of solution .
well , i was doing telephone with a few people in the company , and no one could give me a reasonable answer , until finally i finally did telephone with the senior biologists .

90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the cure , the salmon , heavy fish , they have collapsed .
we can step further out and then rearrange the data , and see that circuit disease and cancer are the common suspicion , but not for everybody .
unlike the one-way conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new out of it .
my wife , my kids and i have moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and archists have taken over our house .
if i tell you that somebody ordered your life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of insecurity about how happy he is with his living self .

i &apos;m a wall animal . in order to work , i have to stand up and sweat at at at the same time every day , abandon me and really awkward through .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the cube , and they put together a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
so far , these insulanders , they &apos;re always trying to do autark , they have a little web that has nothing to do with our connection and nothing to it .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions of technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed world , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest of it .
and imagine if i &apos;ve already negotiated as a five-year-old child with dr. p. , trying to stop these practices , naturally without success .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of map the electrical proportions of the island one to three very precisely .
bg : well we need one of these scalable , generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
now , intuitive ability is not only before apple has a fundamental economic factor , elementary success factor , if i &apos;m trying to harness technology devices to human beings .
a lot of journalists called me the question : &quot; what test are you going to do that tells us whether caster semenya is female or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields of one thing that &apos;s wrong .
just as you knew at the time in the village who has something about who and when , this is what &apos;s happening now over this expansion of our own devices on a global scale .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and get them to play together some kind of game to control their health better .
if you &apos;re playing also , you can see some nuances here zooming upward eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are surprising .
i recently made a survey of over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that a typical american american does on one day is 70 .
a few weeks later , the fireguards got a letter from the house owner , where they added themselves for the more brave use of their house rescue .

and then we screwed up a d.v.d brenner and took the laser out , and then tried to focus on this camera .
they should discuss this strategy of innovation , and they would have been shocked by the ridiculously low money spent on these innovative approaches .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off that el .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instructions is very small that , by chance , they &apos;re making numbers , so none of the instructions are actually going to do this .
that is , instead of remembering ourselves individually , we have standardized , widespread patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories on .
they &apos;re also in such an artistic aspect of this with biological materials , and , yes , also electronics route , and combined that in a pretty remote way .
and these scientists simply documented the different topics that these ceo has been doing , and how much time they spend making decisions related to the issues .
now , if we go on and look at age , let &apos;s say 40 years or more , we see that accidents are actually the main thing about which people should worry about .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
and by the way , we &apos;re wandering and circulating and mixing so much that you can no longer say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find statement .
it was exposed in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material took it , so we ended up with only one cell at the end with a new chromosome .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and i should do that too , because that love story , as romantically , is also inspiring .
everybody thinks i &apos;d gone off between titanic and &quot; avatar , &quot; and would have celebrated the nails on a towel on a beach somewhere .
now , that &apos;s good , apart from paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and people should just stop worrying .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady tuckers of the engine , clapping any wave on the bug , the long and empty horizon .
it looks something like this , who has no freedom , can &apos;t be drawn to responsibility for his actions and claims , and therefore he &apos;s unacceptable .
it &apos;s the living self that attacks the physician -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt now if i file you here ? &quot;
we should call it what it is , an advertisement in degradation , a commercial that quickly challenges ecological capital that enables this production to happen .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and eventually even explode the centrifuge .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use stored co2 that could simply be brought to production stores , converting co2 into fuel to drive this process .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
so if you take the system in the way that i was taught , and you extract all the miserable health professionals , then at the end there &apos;s no one left .
a lot of arguments against it . fish pollution the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
and because they work much harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they disagree in their weight , in energy consumption , a little 30-billion people .
now , do all of these randomly chosen instructions , do all of the programs , and ultimately pick the ones that i want to be the closest . &quot;
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the beaches in venice , my children were brought in , my dog too , and we created this .
but i think in this framework here , and with the intention of doing something real from a deception , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go off the stage .

the second trap is a confusion of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between being happy in his life and being happy about his life or being happy with his life .
if this device sequences a rna-or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls the health department and prevents a pandemic before its outbreak .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexuals are not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be spread all the bandwidth .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , at one point when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
and from my point of view , the scientific method of trying things out is to see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of humanity &apos;s greatest achievements .
so from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and only from that degradation to yes , to the idea that a hundred percent renewable yes .

and our system also has an award increase , because we &apos;re not going to do 20 percent with this el and also an award increase on all the other things .
this is a people who are not cognitively different from the colors of blue and green , because the celestial scene is the equivalent of the forest that people depend on .

and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell .
we only have for two years of phosphorus , and already , through phosphorus mining in the world , much more uranium is being used in all the nuclear facilities .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of recognition of civic honor rights is going to be as high as before the passage of voting legislation .
and as far as isolation goes , if we colonize as a species away , there will be insulation and the changes in the environment that evolution could produce in a natural way .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , a director has to lead , a leader has to be like a ship captain or something .
what do you believe like the average achievement of a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birthday worker , should be a rescue assistant ?

my call to anyone who &apos;s flying today is : imagine if the same thing is happening on your flight -- please not -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then create a visual effect for , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .

armstrong twittered about us , and then , in december , the time-magazine has honored us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
well , very briefly , another reason that we can &apos;t consciously think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people who use the things that we design .
and i went back through the same torture of shame and self-doubt , felt liberated , and went bark to work until it happened again and again and again .
they were the idea that people who had political power should have this political power because of the devastated blood line from grandfather to son and so forth .
so , these connections , their connections around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and strange of quantum mechanics .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably allowed to go home four hours more , but your employer , or someone can come up with you in the four hours correctly .
urgency optimism is the desire to do something immediately , to master a barrier , together with the belief that we have a founded hope for success .
it &apos;s hard for us to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .

the riders for intractable objects are not just humans , but also the light that appears to you and the wind that sticks past you and the heat of space .

no longer a building that would open to let it open , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without becoming wet .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static , static building blocks to a world where everything was interactive .

of course , designers are not only concerned with the subject of perceptions and neural processing , or cognitive sergonomy , but primarily with the subject of human objectivity .
now if you look at the extremes , the plans that offered two fonds had a partial rate in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
when you get more intuitive , then i have to put my little friend back here and look , what does that mean now , from the perspective of cognitive sergonomy , when is actually a little bit intuitive ?
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched -- apart from the pocahonic story , why were you so touched by the image world ?
so i started a company with my good friend , stan winston , who was the best makeup and creature-designer at that time , called digital domain .

i live professionally from building computers , and i know that i can &apos;t use the mechanism that i use to build computers without the recent advances in computer technology .
that is to say there could be something , on average , which female brains different from male brains , which makes us more aware of highly complex social relationships , and make us more aware of the need for protecting needs .
i think of my footage of these iceberg as if i &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , conscious that they exist in these individual moments of this way , and they will never exist again .
and maybe that change could happen because i &apos;ve encountered so many people who have opened doors to me , rather than meeting people who are restricting me or trying to retool an idea .
there &apos;s a research direction called geoengineering , which involves various techniques to delay warming , so that we could get 20 or 30 years longer to come together .
from an evolutionary standpoint , you and i , like boster rockets , are designed to send the genetic question into the next stage of the orbit , and then fall into the sea .
now we can do it more deeply . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , expand their lives .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all of the things that i had always imagined when i read these books .
it &apos;s a river that leads all these things to , of which rivers today tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , waste of skull control .
after which logic this deception , this self-deception , the willingness to disseminate a different reality than the one we actually know in the unconscious mind that it &apos;s kind of valid to spread outward .

if you can imagine making these 20 million different genes , or optimizing these processes to make octan , or making new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology with a small team than the last 20 years of science .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we get this zoom-technology to every single website like this .
the idea is pretty simple . four teams have to build the largest possible free structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter of tape , about six feet of thread and a marshmallow .
well , if there are lots of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s simply to imagine attractive properties of alternatives that you exclude , that makes you less satisfied with the alternatives you &apos;ve chosen .

in other words , in this mindless , evolutionary way , they have found a way to allow them to dedicate what they were so that this information could be stored and copied .
so for example , texas , at some point in time , decided that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and you get a woman to marry that you have a y chromosome .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built it , so everyone who has set up a fast reactor is a candidate for our first reactor .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like node points to crowdsource these aeds around the world .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproduction medicine , we might be able to reduce that by 10 to 15 percent , but right now we &apos;re seeing a slope by 1.3 .
as we keep pushing our science forward , we &apos;re getting into a zone of discomfort where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve probably had are too simple .

i &apos;m sitting here giving basically gruesome sounds of me , hoping to create a similar idea in your head that has a certain similarity with my original idea .
now , as an underlying question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as an underlying question that is about thinking about it , which allows all of this choice to be done in the industrialized societies , the material is wealth .

and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can enable changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt superattributes , hyper-capacity -- better memory .
now , this is a trick that i often teach small kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
it &apos;s only because of the fact that maria was born three months before him every three months before heinrich -- having the right sex , choosing the right to drink .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be adopted , because through a human gut of course , they are denatured with a name monoamin-oxidase .

but as the already quoted examples of the synonymous dictionaries prove , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we &apos;d all wish : to allow each individual to be a powerful person .

let &apos;s take a look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person of today in a country with strong game culture with 10,000 hours of online play until the 21st year .
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where either one of 10 medications is either false or wrong , where hospital infections are always getting more and more and more payment and more devastating or making dead .

years ago , when i went to college , one of my college teachers asked me , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , they still do it -- a really curious question .
i want to say that i probably know some bright label dogs , which are more collaborative , more intelligent and richer decisions about making their sexual relationships than some 40-year-olds i know .
the other hat that i &apos;ve been wearing in my work is the activist , as a patient lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .

and my nose was always in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts to other worlds , and in a storytelling way , my deep sitting in me , peaceful curiosity .
what it turns out is that if you provide a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aspirintablet , that &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
there was some lawyer or consumer stewards who now could tell for the rest of his life that he went to a burning house to save a creature , just because he was five seconds faster than me .

here &apos;s a perceived shot of the molecule that we made by using these processes -- in fact , we just used yeast mechanisms with the right design of the piece , we added them in . yeast then automatically assembles them .
in one case , you might have someone with an xy chromosome base , and the sry gene at y chomosomes the protogonads that we all have to grow up in high .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms will shrink the exploration of happiness , and i am one of the many researchers of well-being who have raped the exploration of happiness in that same way .

when we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s going to exceed all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we turned to different mechanisms .
and so i get a very different view from the city , a very different sense , which is that i see negative and positive zones of a city , and so in this way , a very different virtual map from a very real city .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a retailer , a retailer , in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boots .
but that &apos;s the nicest thing that can happen , because this is group compulsion , group compulsion , to help patients , because this could be used against obesity , or it could be able to reject patients .
cohler evolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in electrification , and therefore we have refrigerators , climate conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking at biohacking for a few years now , and this is what i started doing , because i just wanted to know more about it , and i wanted to do it for myself , most of all , what i learned in this way in college , theoretically .
and if i then take another step further into these natural user interfaces , where , by voice , by touch , by touch , by gesture , by touch , by gesture and by mouse and cursor , i need to be even faster and more immediate .
if you allow someone to activate their own internal forces -- the human mind is so empirical -- if they can do that , and for someone at a critical moment they open a door , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
most women , like i do -- i believe being a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosome structure , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually respond to androgens .
that is , you &apos;ve found yourself so that you &apos;ve spoken a shared language , you could communicate with each other , you &apos;ve moved to the same cave , you &apos;ve moved to other areas , you &apos;ve created cities or villages , and you &apos;ve sort of created tribal society .
when you live in california , there &apos;s a census decision in this spring that &apos;s actually about doing a job of implementing something of the money stream that otherwise flows into the policy of punishment .

they empowered us to tell the story of neuromarketing , just as we tell the story in this movie that you use mris today to mimic the brainstorms of the brain to make both commercials and films .
now if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials , some of them come from science , some of them , some of them , even less , come from economics . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from music .
in other services , like making fertilizers , 105 : 05 : 56,000 -- r : 05 : 58,000 or air transport or air transport , the playground is much smaller .
and i left medical school with the impression that if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible as possible , that i was immune to making mistakes .
that is , i &apos;ve actually shifted them to the point where they don &apos;t recognize a pattern in it anymore , but i &apos;ve dictionalized them within a very short time , to see this dog again and again in this prescribed image .
not even to burn the seed a little bit better and defend it and lose it in the burn plant all the materials for cycles , but first to ask , how do you close cycles ?
because in the moment i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from behind , this finger is moving here , my time finger , just from where it was , to a position where it &apos;s stretched out like this .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her brand personality has separated two , but has inspiring pages -- the morgan spurlock-brand is an eight-hour brand .
we see this here , when i design things , then i can confuse them like on the right-hand side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can sort of make them intuitively by showing things .
immediately after this election between the 21st and february 24th , a delegation of about 30 famans went to the two places in the world that were most interested in getting into the city hall business .
the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencer for live endeavors that we &apos;ve developed recently and are operating in the seats as sound , such as leadership , bass and drudgery .

but when i was talking to him , and i asked him why he was making these interventions -- it was high-risk surgeries -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be treated very badly , and therefore he had to do it .

i &apos;m out of the house , so of course , i &apos;m also involved in the subject of curiosity , and how curiosity also changes our thinking again , and why maybe we &apos;re going to lose also curiosity , and so on and so forth .
and when is , of course , a little bit intuitive , and how can i , as a creator , influence this and shape things like that , that they &apos;re user-friendly , that &apos;s possible , because then they &apos;re fun and easy to use ?
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up less happy with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make mistakes -- those who constrain the battlefield and those who constrain the battlefield with bad results and those with good results .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do its work because we &apos;re afraid we &apos;re a really sleepy gas , and it keeps millions of people from blooming .
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the baffin islands when i went to the narwhal jagd with inuits , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
i don &apos;t have to adjust these things emotionally , because right around the corner there will always be another crazy , colorful , outfit that only wakes for me when i love a little bit and searching .
now , deciding not to buy a glass of brand is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our diary -- but it turns out that the overload problem also affects us with very consequence decisions .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite human participation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the figure , found nothing and concluded that this was the business cards of the devil , and killed the five missiones with the spear .
so what i &apos;d like to do with this sentence is to close a and again give the clue , designers also have to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in this sense thank you very much for your attention and your request .
but it would be worse if i wouldn &apos;t remember , over 20 years ago , when i first told when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer , that i had been faced with the same kind of anxious reaction .
if we &apos;re in a world of play , i think a lot of us are turning into our best version , at any moment and instantly willing to try and solve the problem , as long as we need , try it again after the failure .
are you not afraid that you &apos;re going to follow your life and never come out of that , and you &apos;re going to die on a crumpled dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
and that &apos;s where i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up , because things are always going to be more intuitive , more natural , more user-friendly , and that &apos;s where you have to look at what &apos;s actually natural to us humans , what &apos;s user-friendly or intuitive .
and if i just sit down another halboval , suddenly we don &apos;t see one more unit , which is circle , circle , circle , and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , one circle , another circle .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men are either in prison , in jail , in currency or with conditions of punishment .
i &apos;ve always accomplished my synonymous dictionary in writing , but i &apos;ve been done with the process of writing , and i realized that i &apos;ve never proposed in my life what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
and it &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that this wedding technology that you &apos;re encountering is actually bringing you into the future , but in fact , the future is right with us , in our archaic roots .
and i definitely know that it would be -- in my situation -- very dangerous to begin to sort of slow down this dark path of suspect -- especially in the circumstance in which i &apos;m in my career right now .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i came here to say to this young man , don &apos;t lose the target . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
later on the day , i was driving around this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand on the edge of an epic victory at any given time that we prefer to spend all of our time in these games .
i showed these two slides last year to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , near three million years , had shrunk the size of the lower 48 states by 40 percent .
and because i was born without washing legs , and my feet had been set up after them , and i only had a few toes on that , and a few toes on the other foot , he was the bridge , this stranger had to bring the bad news .
so what &apos;s going on in &quot; the atmosphere of ever-cell , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom is completely covered with brands -- from the cover sponsor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the marke x .
they then , over a three-month period of time , students with a &quot; enough &quot; note &quot; very well , and it was told to them that they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote in .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found , something very fundamental : in most of the life &apos;s existence in single organisms , each cell divides , and all the genetic information of the cell is continued to lead into both dead cells .
at the time , it was just as a monkey where adel , klerus and others said , actually , you &apos;re insane when people start reading , then afterwards they want to talk to each other , and of course , that &apos;s completely fatal .
and then i gave it up to six and a half , and then we turned together with friends , i became a co-founder of the company of solon , which then became one of the largest cell manufacturers in the world with spin-off q-style manufacturers .
when a performer in spain did something impossible , something magical : eye-allah , ol√© , ol√© , allah , great , bravo &apos;s inevitable , there it is : a glimpse of god .
that was worth closing me in the clean room for all this year , because , you check that , the massroots difference between one individual atom and that piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there is no bio-farm , no bioland , no entropy progression , and how they all name , that allow our own excreations to go back .
and the message is , we need to get on these rotating masses if , in a way , we &apos;re 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we even want to reach them .
he killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beef , bone and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can break the trajectory of aids .
and i wonder today how much of my vision as a strong and powerful girl has shaped my self-image , and i &apos;ve been able to think of myself as one of nature as one of very strong , powerful and breathal human beings .
it &apos;s inside -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code consists of regular letters that we use for symbolizing -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve amplified it 10 .22 times .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re called from my general physician , so he can see where my weight problem is , not only in the moment i need kardiological support or something , but also in a look at the past .
it &apos;s an image of the first radiation particle that took all the way back to the lhc , then , in advertently colonized with a part of the lhc to put a rain of particles on the detector .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 80s when i just started elementary school , and started to build and shape my self-image outside my family &apos;s field , even in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so attractive , at the end , we &apos;re not at the end of our technology , not at the things that we &apos;re developing , not at our intellect and minds .
but , as we think , the only way that biology will have a huge impact with no increases in the cost of food or restriction of its availability is when we see co2 as a source material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
now the amazing thing is that the betakarboline contained in liane are mao-inhibitors of exactly the kind that are necessary to enable the tryptamins . so ask yourself .
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people go up , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to insult them , or frankly , they go away .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to take a strike and use less , but on average , that number will rise every year , and therefore double , more than double , the number of services that are provided to every person .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw it with a laser pointer on it , only registering the negative area .
so there are big prizes here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say , for example , that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you also need to deal with the risk of the energy coming from where else .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s going on in evolution , and how we think about the place of human beings in evolution , and most importantly , as we look forward into the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of memory itself , and you can think of the memory of the self as one that kind of drags the living self through experiences that the heritage itself doesn &apos;t need .
i started working through scientific literature about how these centrifuges are built in natung , and found that they &apos;re structured in what we call cascades , and each cascade contains 164 centrifuge .
this is a problem because warming is freezing the frozen reason for the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon , which , when it &apos;s monitoring , is transmitted from microbes to methane .
and what we also found is that the goal of attacking was actually to let it happen slowly and remarkably -- obviously to try to have warning engineers despair , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to quickly get behind it .
so maybe that technological change is far more clear than ever that there has always been a different truth , which is that every human being in society can give something special and very powerful and that the human ability to adapt is our biggest plus .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that has become the information technology on the curve of moore &apos;s law is going to make great jumps , and the price performance quality doubles every 12 to 24 months .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we &apos;ve sort of become aware of ourselves , o.k , it &apos;s now giving us as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are always chatting there and so forth .
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on its head so that instead of always going from one to the other , we could begin to go from a lot of things to a lot of things , and by seeing patterns that would have remained otherwise hidden ?
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents you would never walk , and never be as moving as other kids or that you could never live an independent life , and since then they just punished me . &quot;
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or pay a rise by four percent by the amount they were willing to pay for the savings account .
again , the idea is , imagine that again we involve people to do something and to change the environment -- almost like what we call to incorporate cloud motion , how to move a check , but with a cloud .
it was on a piano course for music students in my beloved old teacher , professor jgrude , a well-known beethoven specialist , concert pianist and long-term professor of music college here in stuttart .
we took a ps3 camera , we put it apart , we put it on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , the software can be downloaded for free .
we look in this web , we see the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s nine comma hertz , we start making a few valves , then a little bit of merry steam comes back up again .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that is pretty much everything they actually hate , we made them work in government .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals of those people , 60,000 years ago , had worn older people and people with severe physical injuries , and maybe that happened because the life experience of these people was valuable for society .
but this is my prototype that looked a little bit like this , which was sort of like a branch on it , attached the thing to it , to it , to it , to it , to pressure , but that was too high , the thing broke .
now we have &quot; three hives &quot; laws that always bring people behind bars for a bicycle theft , for the theft , for the little bit of good , rather than that you force them to give things back to the victims .
and yes , so , you can see it &apos;s relatively heterogeneous , so that &apos;s where there &apos;s a stop from people who are doing it alone to big , so larger organizations who already do it more formal already in institutionalized form .
&quot; when we fought against oppression in eastern europe , we wanted everything , but what we needed most was hope , a spiritual orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in hopeless places , and to be witness . &quot;
i graduated , and i hope that the video works , a very , very nice project , which is the bachelorship work by michael burk , ann-kathrin krence , joris klause and jan-moritz trash .
and it gets better , the things you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photo , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are literally now being dematerialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
heinrich , because you assume he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you he &apos;s xy -- because you assume he &apos;s male , he can now be attracted to what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad sitting jeans if there &apos;s only one way to buy it is that if you &apos;re unhappy , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do because our science is making such advances in anatomy that we have to reach a point where we have to admit that a democracy that is based on anatomy could fall apart ?
so if i do that now , the profilers in the crime place , go there , collect any hair samples , and then they turn that method on , and then they can say , &quot; o.k , this hair belongs to this human being . &quot;
he contained the dog and improvised the dog , took the skeleton of the dog , improvised a sleepy , pasted a different dog , and knocked on the ice sheets with the colored knife on the belt .

i committed myself to the place to his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way that he can do his art again .
now i must confess when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but every year , it &apos;s come to my growing doubt .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines do is , we think at a certain level of abstraction , we overlay that machine , and the machine does something that exceeds our skills far higher , better and faster than we ever could .
i &apos;m a professional historian , and in this case , i study how humans went to anatomy -- that is , human bodies , animal bodies -- how they went to fluids with body concepts , how they thought about bodies .
and then the next one , which has already worked with a nice neural model or mental model like the software called eergonoma , which is that you would have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the minister of health , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt the evidence of my expert on mammography , &quot; or any cancer jellyfish that wants to treat his patients with kaffe-envelope .
the reason why kids with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s cup or siamesian twins , whether it &apos;s intersexual -- surgeons often are adapted to the norm is not because it &apos;s your physical health of advantage .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like this . centuries ago in the deserts of north africa , people gathered into monthly fears with sacred dances and music that had been kept for hours -- to dawn .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought molecules were shooting around in a particular way rather than accidentally , a handle on the field of nature .
the spirits can be cut up from underneath the great water , respond to the rhythm of dance , to push the soul of the living , so that the akolyth becomes the god for a short shining moment .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of fortune 50-business , and there &apos;s something about this task that allows deep insights to be enabled into the nature of collaboration , and i want to share with some of them .
among then , there are things that have arrived completely in day-to-day life , which most people don &apos;t even know , for example , are washing enzymes that allow us to wash at 450 degrees of laundry , are also genetically optimized enzymes .
i think they were so brave and so radically in what they did , that every few years i took a look at the malignant musical music in 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
in some of the expeditions i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermalsources , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before and had found at the time when we saw them had no words at all .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics isn &apos;t persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website receives 35 million excellence every month .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem-solvers all over the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of those standing at the edge of an epic victory .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights to people like this , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retriever that probably deserve soundscapes more than some people i know .
what kindergarten kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow and prototype , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have a multi-times the opportunity to repair bloody prototypes .
they knew that about 75,000 hondurans left their country every year to go out to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in hduras .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to put together a stereo system -- loudspeakers , cd players , a cassette player , radio , stronger . and in this one electronics business , there are so many stereos .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 worst selling catastrophic scatteries , they found that the revenues went up 87 percent -- a result of both , the increase in sales and reducing cost .
what we &apos;ve learned from cross-cultural studies is that women , on average -- not every but on average -- tend to tend to give a lot of attention to complex social relationships and worry about people who are vulnerable within the group .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago that had brought some siamesian twins with them to separate them , partly to make a name .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you think about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that available if things get faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
this was a huge outcry at the time , because , of course , you begin to manifest the living language in the form of writing , which means what fluid and living is , i start and i grab it in stone , and so i manipulate it .
to make up these theories , let &apos;s remind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely high-gram sabotage , it has to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because that &apos;s where most infections have been reported .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m initially italian , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is because of something very interesting happening in formula 1 in the last few decades .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious one that immediately jumps up without being able to do something about it , and the things that you know are very different , so that you can sound much better for you and others .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and chairs , just to discover and look through , immediately characterized by visibility and access to information , especially in terms of business skills -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
descendants of the ancient tyrannian civilization populating the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , and as a result of the conquest , these people moved back to an isolated volcanic massive , rising above the caribbean coastal plain .
and before that back , i &apos;ve been in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation in human computer in which the human computer &apos;s relationship is concerned with how our tools , or how the computer is changing from the computer to the digital assistant .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all talk only one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be that language of yoruba . let them be canonical .
so , she runs to the house , and she looks for the paper , and the poem goes through it , and she grabs a pencil just as it goes through it , and then she goes through it , and then she said -- she said -- it was like grasping her other hand and grabbing it .
if i took this post seriously , i would be born to a world that someone would perceive like me as a person who can &apos;t walk their lives in any positive way , but today , i &apos;m celebrated for the odds and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
i think that the interactive media within us has been addressing archaic , cognitive models , so thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time ago , and that we can just regenerate them through interactive media right now .
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water memory inside , inside that they can actually go back to cellulosic base , then they can plant with a baby in israel or in tunisia in hundreds of hundreds of trees .
tan le , anonymous editor of footscray , was now tan , refugee and social activist , who was invited to speak in places she &apos;d never heard of , and in places whose existence she could have never imagined .
and it turns out that under a 60,000 dollars a year &apos;s income , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a 600,000 dollars a year &apos;s income .
i &apos;m more likely to be aware of the fact that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome visities , but we &apos;re open to hugging them to grab them at the sharp to even use a fight expression and maybe even dance with them .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the setting of a violent confrontation that has been ravaged for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
so this whole discussion of how currently is going to move and move , energy turn , how to go , on the island , for example , we have five to 30 percent accuracy energy , so we have to control the wind and the sun .
so we started with a number of volunteers who helped us , a little over a year ago , in seattle , mark the things that they waited away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away anyway .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people that i wanted to reach a hand and didn &apos;t do it , all the fences i wanted to flick , all the experiences i wanted to make and never made .
how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reclaim , and we expect the government to reflect our values and fulfill our needs , and then didn &apos;t change much ?
now this could happen within a single organism &apos;s lifetime , whereas before that , hundreds of thousands of years were used , because this information had to be learned by the individuals who died because of this fruit , because these information processing structures were not there .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a water facility , rather than just for these fish , but for you and me .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of human beings is widely convicted , but the ethnic , the destruction of human life , is not only convicted , but celebrated as part of a developing strategy .
what if you could change the sperm and the egg or the newly fertilized egg to give your kids a better chance for a healthier life -- elimination of diabetes , eliminating the hemophilia , reducing the risk of cancer ?
because of the bottom of the ocean there are bacteria that are thermophil , and in doing so , the hot dam will survive otherwise if fish were there , it would have vacuum cooked fish at the end of it , yet they managed to make a habitable environment for themselves .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper that said , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except for evolution . &quot;
there &apos;s , for example , the anecdote that the report of a chapter soundso watching big fish happen in this area cannot be used , or of fishermen scientists don &apos;t normally be acquired because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
that as a translator , not only does you have to translate the text into another language , but you also have to understand the deeper sense of words and literacy slope so that you can make a meaningful translation , everybody who has to do with foreign languages .
not only do you understand that that means that people need to eat dog food when they &apos;re retired , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss large investment employees in their employers .
and , if i step out again and look at everything , i might be able to rearrange my course into my search past , here , looking for nepotistic , here for bing , or here for live labs .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually extend the reflection of patient a by simply letting the tube in without too much of it .
you do it for the will for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment . you do it for the exploration , and because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team .
i took them with and made them access to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments and so on .
and all this time , they are culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that keep the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that ecological -- equilibrium .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you have proved that the living self of patient a &apos;s is worse off it , and you have proven that the memory of patient a is much better off , because now you have given patient a a a a a better story about his experience .
at this point , the patients come in . they can take control , not only can be chapters on their own ship , but can also help us in health care with the challenges that are ahead of us , and the cost explosion of health , double-demand , and so on .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of advocating plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that , if combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version so the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
so the tedtalk , in a very simple form , represented that a charter city is a place whose first country is uninhabited , a founding contract that determines the laws that exist there , and the people are willing to decide whether to live in either of these rules or not .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we look at all these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very improbable that this would lead to one living cell .
if you just gave me one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , halved energy cycle , without co2 , i would take that wish .
and then there &apos;s a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that counts and receives the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor speaks to by asking the question , &quot; how have you felt lately ? &quot;
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is somebody who &apos;s freaked him when he &apos;s retired because he knows he &apos;s not very good at branding when he &apos;s covered in a meter of snow .
we followed the geneaology eight generations back , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people something about it , they assumed that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with the spear .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that came to the market recently was about how to best get the choices , was something that david laibson has very strongly founded , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the malayan coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple to give me one of the men on the platform .
about an hour after she arrived at home , after sending her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and the rescue assistants brought her back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock state .
well , what this thing does is it takes the infecting values of sensors -- so for example , printing sensors and vibrational sensors -- and it provides legitimate code that still runs during the attack , with false data .
and there was a time when there was only jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they missed them , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and when they carried long enough and often washed enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it processes information doesn &apos;t count them , one , two , three , but it sees them as a group .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how it all started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story about it , which is that at that time , little oil droplet were screaming around , which had different kinds of recipes for chemicals .
and these sounds and this rhythm have put together the geology , which is a region &apos;s topography , which , of course , has enabled you to defragment these songs and put them differently and move to the left , to the right , and also to the outplace .
so if you look at google glass , for example , it &apos;s such a concept that recombines the virtual world with the real world , that is our affinity to virtualization , to feel the virtual as something that is normal , natural .
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years here , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a random measure of the technology that i want to present with a graph , the graph will be silly .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we made a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation ever , and i think quite often in relation to how many years ago i think of other holidays .
and maybe even a little bit of a view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things in all sorts of post-humane futures that i can think of as a science fiction fan .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avoid things that you &apos;re not sure of , you &apos;re not going to be afraid , you &apos;re going to avoid these elements , and you &apos;re going to be welcome to them , and you &apos;re actually turning them into something positive for yourself , and that &apos;s a historical chess .
we don &apos;t have the situation like in iran , for example , where a man who feels sexually drawn to other men who are punished with death , unless he &apos;s willing to commit a gender transformation in which case he can stay alive .
and they &apos;re going to get healthier by using the tricoder , and they &apos;re better trained by the khan academy , and by having the opportunity to use 3d printers and infinite computing , to be much more productive than they &apos;ve ever had before .
we now know that gender is complicated enough , that we must admit that nature doesn &apos;t draw a line between male and female , or between male and sexual and sexual and intersexual , and tactical ; it &apos;s actually us giving that line as natural .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect for a while , and it may seem odd that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it the same way that i think of it as , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to happen if somebody believes absolutely enough about it . &quot;
we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the √©tole at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scala in mailand -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as a impulse for the stream fire .
there are some pilots that do this at a 60 percent level -- 80 percent level , but getting it to 100 percent will be very difficult . and getting an agreement to store co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the warehouse question .
so what they got was this : here &apos;s your name : my tedtalk , which they have no idea what the topic is going to be , which could eventually fly around the ears after content , especially if i let their company go for their participation .
and in this song , we will rediscover the possibility of being what we are : people with full consciousness , who are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens need to be able to flourish a space , and there are great moments of optimism .
these older people are coming to me now and saying , &quot; mr , stevenson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re telling people to stop saying that for the first time in the history of our nation we have to do with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
as a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , and they &apos;re so bad sometimes , and he &apos;s disappearing in the streets of scid row , always exposed to this horror and the torture of his own mind .
the people in the back , or those people , at some point , will say , &quot; well , this looks quite impressive , but if it were real , it would -- look , here &apos;s a hole , and there , if it were really real , it would float . &quot;
the leaders of the government in hduras would rely on the help of partnerships , they could benefit from their partnerships countries that they would support in the creation of the laws for this charter and in permission that anyone could trust the charter is really done .
she ran like the devil to the house while she was pursued by this poem , and it was all about getting quickly enough to get to a piece of paper and a pencil so that if it went through her , she could capture it and stick it on the sheet .
he drove at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a tune that , as it often is in inspiration , is elusive to him . and he wants it . she &apos;s gorgeous . he lethes afterwards , but he can &apos;t grasp it .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had a friend , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just figured out that he had eggs and a uterus .
in fact , i &apos;ve spent most of my career trying to pursue this for terrible situations , and all of this is trying to study social belonging in ways that they are compelling and interesting , and hopefully , in a way , understand what makes them fun and accessible to the audience .
but since only one company , one agency was willing to help us -- and it was only because i know john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with my team directly .
this curiosity also turned out that whenever i was not in school , i was walking around the forests and gathering samples , frogs and snakes and beetles and ponds , all brought home and looked under the microscope .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the power of bringing new elements into play -- like the testicles -- and also how the game needs both trust and promotes -- while at the same time it makes an awful lot of fun .
for the next few weeks , i was making imaginations , and i first learned the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to your colleagues about it .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i did with gur huberman , eme kamenica , wei jang , where we &apos;re looking at the decisions for retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 places throughout the united states .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , in how little appetite do i have on the toes of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question : why do we give memories so much weight in the course of the weight that we give experiences ?
so where the founding fathers were extremely concerned about figuring out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more of a concept of not just how to protect each other , but how to care for each other .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the modern artist who was trying to dominate this uncontrollable creative impulse that lived in him and deal with them .
by playing music and talking about music was from this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , skilled , skilled , skilled musician in juilliard .
the main reason for this is that maybe we enjoy looking at these huge shelves of mayonaise , mustard , essimist and brand , but we can &apos;t actually pull the comparison and the limitations and then actually choose something out of the fantastic offering .
you can think of this cultural web as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be defined as the sum of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been created by the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
a continent is always released , because the guess was that there are no religious faith in sub-saharan africa . of course there was one , and voodoo is simply the remain of this very profound religious thought that occurred during the tragic diaspora of slavery .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to confine , and unimportant possibilities get rid of , well , then there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a cost of reducing , r &amp; amp ; d , and there &apos;s an improvement in decision-making .
and one day he looked at me in one of my exercises -- these practices were just tiring and miserable -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll one day smash one of these beaks .
and they simulated wind and sun , and the load , and they came to the conclusion , a really exciting conclusion that , after 20 years , you get to the conventional system , which takes about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour , about 40 cents a kilowatt-hour view .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be an access problem , it can be something that simplifies things like things , so an arbitrary problem to start a question , and how can you do it differently or how can you do it better ?
steer grain of vegetables , pest control of monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken on fish all the time , the agricultural industry just asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how horrible could that be ? &quot;
not through recent mice and tractor inventions , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through chain acids , but through forests , not through fishing boats and nets , but through fish in the sea .
that &apos;s got a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and partnerships with scientists to deal with these technologies and ask questions and process creatively , there &apos;s museum exhibitions and yes , all kinds of things .
you aggregate out co2 , which leads to temperature elevation , and that elevation of temperature has some very negative consequences . effects on weather and maybe worse , indirects that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt to such fast changes , and so all systems collapse .
now , not exactly what i had hoped for , but i went up -- the stairs up , down the halls , down the hallway , along the real &quot; firemen , who , at this point , had already been pretty good at triggering into the bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and she rolled the poem through it , and she missed it . she said it would keep moving across land , and -- as she said -- look for another poet search for a different poet .
this may be a moderate contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core message here is that we need to work on all five of them , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they shock us , because all of them have significant problems .
and where you can see how far we &apos;ve gone from what we really wanted to reach and could do , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , openbach has a program , until 20 , you want to be here climaneutral , right ?
in my 20-year medical sentience and journalism , i created a personal medical trial on medical errors and false treatments , so that everything i could learn for one of my first articles , which i wrote for the toronto star of my show , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what comes to the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the lasagne horse meat and no beef is no longer beef or other phenomena , which is i just want to tumble this , and i want to kundle it .
upattributes are things that are playful , like the fresh prince , contemporary , adventurous , dropped out and lovely like erol flynn , agile , professional , magical and mystic like gandalf .
in our desire to protect the people who care about us and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even prognosis to the quality of life that she expects , we need to watch that we don &apos;t have the basis that someone &apos;s actually disabled .
because we have this self-deception of being great , descending from the highest creatures , not from such a grandiose , of something as an organism that still exists in comparable to a stone and other things that are inexquisite to us .
he spoke in a very healthier and social tone about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never do it in the baseball world series , all because of the tacky passage of the first violin in the last sentence by beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of the life of an unknown suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who graduated every day as long as 20 years , by telling and lowering each other the stories of their day , we &apos;re still three in the same bed .
but we don &apos;t even , when we hear someone say something like this , because we &apos;ve known these kinds of statements for so long , somehow we &apos;ve embraced the notion so embodied and collective that creativity and suffering somehow come together , and that art , at the end , always leads to the soul .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures embracing commands from divinity .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and using anonymous and aggregated information from this network that is being collected from operators anyway to understand how the city works .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we either blame rousseau and the old framework of noble wild , which in his simplification is a racist thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that mimic the problem of choosing overload -- limited -- get rid of the excess alternatives ; concretize it -- do it real ; categorize -- we can better deal with more categories , fewer possibilities ; we can prepare for complexity .
but the process and the severe reference that surrounds it was raised when he took the genius out of it , where he wasn &apos;t causing anything to be a trouble and left him back to where he came from , so he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be an internalized , agonizing thing .
that seems a little bit disgusting at first , so i repeat it so that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 to ninety percent renewable , and then that rest remains , the last 10 , the last 20 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and that won &apos;t work too , that you &apos;re doing it from batteries .
but will 17 markenmate partners who were willing to take control of this control that wanted to do business with someone as mindful and playful as me , and who ultimately enabled us to tell stories that we didn &apos;t usually have -- stories that a cup would never normally support .
but in fact , they &apos;d been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never do reasonably simulate whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputing , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes ! with the right material approach , it looks like it works .
this peculiar event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called &quot; rare , pray , love , culture &quot; which , unlike all of my previous books going out into the world for any reason , became a big mega-event , international pollinator thing .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snake of work and all the other things that we really care about is government , at the core , in the words of tim o &apos;rilly , &quot; what we do in common , that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s walk forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . you wouldn &apos;t have thought we were going to have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
that &apos;s when you focus on a laser beam , on one in the room , so you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move them in that focus , so that &apos;s captured , so it &apos;s basically like a tractor beam .
i mean , most of our lives -- and i calculated this -- you know , the psychological presence is true for about three seconds , which means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a lifetime . there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any trace in one month .
bill gates : in order to do the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonably , you &apos;re only in the 100 million .
this really works , this is done in academic form , and then we thought , o.k , maybe we can get there , then we took a webcam that screens up , turns the lens off , turn around , and then you have a microscope that blows up about four hundred times .
if i show you 600 magazines and i split them into 10 categories or i show you 400 magazines and split them into 20 categories , then you think i &apos;ve given you more choice and a better choice than i would have given you the 400 to which if i gave you the 600 .
i believe a significant -- not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointment because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain themselves these experiences , think it would be their fault .
the first thing that , when you &apos;re a child , as a baby , is that you care about what divorces you have like this , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the potter , the more , the more , the more , of course , their curiosity is wound up .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at this moment joined the cult of the saatcorn , which created the poetry of the shaman through the prose of priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and overshooting -- took place only 10,000 years ago .
it would be great if we could exchanging this paradigm of normal thinking against another of possibilities or strength to even make it a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of a lot of children , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
i then tried to expand that a little bit in my lab , and then bought me a little bit of steady hand-hand equipment on ebay , and did a little d.n.a analysis , tried to do a father &apos;s test , so that &apos;s how / d.n.a fingerprinting is going to go back home .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means that at the end he took the hammer and threw it on moses -- actually , you can still see a little spot underneath -- and said , &quot; perch√© non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
but if you buy a new color laser printer this year in 2011 from the leading laser printing factories and print a page , that page has printed bright yellow spots on every page in a pattern that clearly retracks the site on you and your printer .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about the perceiving and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the emphasis of our environment .
well , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the hard position of inheritable , look at them as orginian and colorful , but they sort of narrow to the past as the real world , meaning that our world .
and if you chose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you get an answer . and if you think about memories , you could get another answer .
i had to repeat individual practice a lot of times with these thick , elastic bands -- in different colors -- that &apos;s what you know to build my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything else . i hated them . i flooded them . i hated them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome . it &apos;s got more than 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it from the size of the virus , which we could vary the size of the tape to understand what the components of a living cell are .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it yourself , i want to share with you something -- he gave me permission -- his technique , called the slingshot , which many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator at the student &apos;s home .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; which my friends at autodesk call &quot; infinite computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that enable them to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccines and food , digital medicine , nano-materials and artificial intelligence .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo-acolyths in a trcelia state that acquires glowing coal without burning , an astonishing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body in such a way that it keeps when it gets placed into a state of extreme conviction .
this was the most surreal form of a d√©j√©tovu that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i drill around a corner , i &apos;ve always known what would happen in the light bulb of the vehicle , because i had gone over the film for months when we turned the movie .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing ones at the top of these branches have had success in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has demonstrated the environment of fitness and strength .
and then just came from the do-it-yourself bio org website of the founders , and i said , &quot; o.k , we &apos;ve got to really meet now , really meet , in real life , and then organized two events , one in london , two thousand , and briefly to the u.s. , in san francisco . &quot;
and s o with this premise then brian degger , for example , tried to put together a minimum cord in england , then took a steam printing cow , took a heating plate , and , yes , so soup breakthroughs , and then grew bacteria .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that will depend on the number of people , of the services that every human uses on average , the average energy for every service and the co2 that is emitted per unit of energy .
and the realization of president lobo was that the certainty of the passage that i &apos;ve thought about as a way of getting the foreign investors to come in and build this city could be equally important for all the parties in honduras that have been suffering from fear and suspicion for many years .
i read this list of a friend of mine loud , and i first had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came to &quot; train , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk to you any more , and i had to stop reading and collect me after this random word , and the associated emotional shock .
a group from ankara , which i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a student group who wanted to convey more of the public what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve done so on street little actions , and they &apos;re trying to explain to people what d.n.a is .
what i &apos;m going to first show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve given microsoft as part of an exception just one year ago , and that &apos;s seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where they can either be locally or away with huge amounts of visual data .
and it was really , really bitter , and then you get in such a period of period , and that actually went through a picture where i wondered after 10 years , a thousand d marrow , which was still at the time , basic wages , in the collective of course , to be that great .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket if they don &apos;t count the 10 extra olive oil and 12 balsamicoessig they could buy to make a huge number of their own salat dessings in the unlikely case that none of the 175 is right for them .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that overlaps the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors that can pass information out of the car , pass this information into the system , and then they process it and then use it to send back decisions back to this car and change things in real time while information is being collected .
i was afraid , not because of it , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that he could sink into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin if i started talking about sound and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic risk .
so , the fact is , you will remember , in the 20th century , in 300 years , you will not remember not for your wars or your technological innovation , but rather , the problem is not the change in which we were facing , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either actively supported or passively accepted . so , the problem is not the change .
i had written this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which was supposed to push the bar into things like visual effects and computer-generated effects throughout new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters made using cg , and the main figures should be all cg . and the world should be cg .
i &apos;m probably listening to these two nice girls , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s been nurturing for this bad oko image , because i &apos;ve already begun to study machine building in karlsquiet , technological college , now it &apos;s called , i think , kit .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answering meeting after one of my lectures that reported a story &#91; unclear ... &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible circling sound .
you know ? i think , to allow a mere person that he thinks he or she is like the vessel , like the basin and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to give her a question of human psyche .
it &apos;s actually the one who makes decisions , because if you have a patient who had , say , two mirrors in two different surgeons and decides what to choose , then the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s going to be selected .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economic , and at the same time you can eliminate co2 , then the skeptics also say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in it not emitting co2 , i want it to almost do it , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
you all know the healthy shame when you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s prize , even though that one shrinks on divorce and then you get caught up , and the best friend confronts you with it and leads my terribly discussion , if at the end you do the bad conscience , and you swore you never make such a mistake .
you know , one of the great pleasures of traveling , and one of the joys of ethnography research is to live with the people who can still remember the old days , still feel in the wind , touch them on the rain , taste them in the bitter leaves of the plants .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman , as part of the program -- in fact , do that all of you -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call government for a lot of different problems include that there &apos;s a thylacine in their house .
in fact , the beauty of this is , if you do this , you create agriculture , biogas , on a hectare of five thousand people in favelas , so a farmer can raise about a thousandth of a hundred dollars and wait for that , chickens and pigs and vegetables and fish .
if i were to go to a room full of colleagues and ask their immediate support and tell them what i just told you about , i would not very likely reach the end of the second story before they really did unpleasant , anybody would intervene with a joke , they would change the topic and forget the rest of it .
so by comparing color , contrast and helmet to the edges to the individual images , photographic men , like the field depth , disorders , we owe the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photo , even though a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
we &apos;re at the threshold to amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we need to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time where we have struggled where we have made progress on these things more intense , more fronts than we have now .
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and filming the secret societies that were secure the foundations of duvalians and clay macoutes and the poison that was used to make zombies .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to deal with viencies , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence never fits for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable about answering the questions of people , and i think , gradually , i understand why .
and if i translate this now , for example , in which i take an oversight , select it as a selection , informed in the case , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , transaction , i can throw it somewhere or send it to somebody , or buy it , and so on .
i recommend to all of you to read steves book or to watch the movie so that you understand not only the wonderful connection between these two men created , but also how music helped that connection connect , and how it ended up being the instrument if that word was allowed to get the mithalf , nathaniel off the street .
at the bottom of this picture , you &apos;re looking at the lab in leadership , so there &apos;s such an informed garage with all kinds of lab scaffolding out the university , a group in paris that &apos;s been doing what &apos;s set up and doing pretty interesting things , and i want to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a project .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t come to a place yet , and there are a lot of interesting openings for everything that has been called &quot; nuclear . &quot; there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was here and i met the minister of energy and talked about how this fits to the energy agenda .
for example , no biologist would say that 50 percent or more of all species are about extinct , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenarium in the field of biological diversity -- is barely equivalent to what we know as the most optimistic censorship in the field of cultural diversity .
and then , partly , if you look at the software that we just saw , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety-nine percent of our software today is little intuitive or not usb , including the ipad in many areas or iphone , although it &apos;s much more intuitive than classical software .
the computer vision-algorithms have stuck these pictures together so that they can reconcile the real space in which these shots all have been made near the grassi lake in the canadian rockies . you can see here elements of stated slides or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been spatically related to each other .
so in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro atmosphere tero , we did a study with the people at ing -- employees that all worked for ing -- and these people were all in a convention where they signed their participation for their retirement savings plan .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the burden of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something -- namely the ph.d. -- is somebody who knows nothing and is highly ill , and therefore , not in the best constitution is to make a decision -- namely the patient .
this idea rescued me when i was in the middle of writing , pray , love , i fell into one of those grubs of doubt that we all fall into when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you begin to think it &apos;s a disaster . it &apos;s the worst book ever written .
we also have one of those same aggregate in the same size as it stands there , put it in the hall to actually simulate the full dynamic behavior of the web , so in the hall it looks like this now , there &apos;s the back here , there &apos;s the big battery , there &apos;s all the judges with which we simulate the web .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature that was believed to be living literally in the walls of an artist -- sort of like dobby , the housef -- that came out and the artist at work would sort of be invisible and design the outcome of the work .
if i want to bring one thing to you today is that the sum of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , i want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns occur , and we see trends that wouldn &apos;t otherwise be visible .
interesting historical footnote : when the moars conquered southern spain , they brought this practice . the language changed over the course of the centuries of ze allah , allah , allah &apos;s style to style ol√© , ol√© , ol√© &apos;s disease , which you still hear when you &apos;re fighting and flamenco dances .
and that would be their answer to the bjoun lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from it , the poverty reduction , the reduction of malaria , and so on , there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money on it , while there are better things we can do .
these people have come to wealth online , but they have legally acquired it by , for example , using trojans to raise money from our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or also keynote lovers , collecting our credit card information on the keyboard while buying over an infected computer online .
woman parks kept coming back to montgomery , where she met two of her oldest friends . these older women , johnnie carr , who had organized the montgomery bush boykott -- an incredible african-american -- and virginia durr , a white woman whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king .
and they came up with two builders of this , and they said , &quot; o.k , we make this easier and cheaper , and they just came out of open source , which is freely available hardware , electronics , which assembled this device , and now they &apos;re actually getting this to market power , and are the cheapest providers of these devices in the world .
that made me a different human than my friends were living under the kwakiutl who believe that these forests were entering the place of hukuk and the conbounded celestial beast and the cannibalic spirits that live on the northerners of the world , spirits that they would be participating in their hamatsa-initiation .
a week ago at the national academy of engineering , the dragon prize for francis arnold and wild stemmer , two scientists who , independently , developed the natural process of evolution to encourage the process of working faster and desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- called french &apos;s arnold &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
and i want to also hold towards biology right now , and i want this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because , the d.n.a code is an abstract code , which is yes , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s more matter , which is real matter , and it &apos;s not just cyber .
bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at brighton university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the image , so not the television , the internet , etc . , and so on , what we call today , that these mass media of our memories have fossilized and virtualized our ability to virtualize .
in fact , some happy people and corporations , for-profit and non-profit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let this go again -- buy the nameless rights at the talk that you just saw , who didn &apos;t have a lot of content at the time , and didn &apos;t give a lot of clues about what the topic was going to be .
this is a set of efforts that live by the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being coined by the experience that i had been so successful , as though my life had run so well , because i could avoid the potential of a life with a prosthetic , or whatever humans would perceive me with my disability .
and when these people came and saw who is the best protein folder in the world , this was not a mit professor , even a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked as an assistant of business in a reha-clinic , and at night was the best protein maker in the world .
this , of course , was just a simple trick by dr. p. to make the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , in the sense that the richest five year-old girl in the hospital was going to be in the second hive , but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes , so it became a new and diverse experience .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for this over the past year to do this , i &apos;ve also been looking for this in the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they may have had better or more reasonable ideas about it than we could , how to help us deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
so we have this kind of situation where , as our science progresses , we have to admit ourselves so much more , that these categories that we had thought were stable anatomic categories , which made very simple arrangements to create permanent identities , are much more embarrassed than we thought .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times the amount of energy that you can , say , a carbon molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , the impact on land and other things , almost in your own league .
so i went home and ate with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology to be able to use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that tempt can control a laser , so that he can do graffiti again , that would be brilliant . &quot;
now , if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn out your listening , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book , which is wrong because nothing else will make sense of you in the course of this talk .
a few years ago , the laser prize was awarded to the scientist shinya amanaka for his research where he took a grown-ups , a fibrolic , and by manipulating only four genes , the cell , to take them back to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell is potentially able to become any cell in your body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all sorts of batteries that are made : those for cars , computers , cell phones , cell phones , pockets , for everything . and i &apos;ve compared that to the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , i found that all batteries that we &apos;re producing now could store less than 10 minutes of total energy .
now let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , perhaps three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species that ultimately form in the last 130,000 years .
this is a reconstruction of cathedame &apos;s cathedame , who , only happened in the computer with images of flickr . just put in notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get images of men in t-shirts and on the university sites , etc . each of these orange angels represents a picture that has been discovered as listening to this model .
i once traveled with a young colleague of 6,000 miles from chengdu , west china , through southeast tibet to lhasa , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear . 6,000 sacred monuments that were turned into shock and ashes , 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution by the caves .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , let &apos;s set people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , 11 times higher if that is victims than when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher than when the complained black and the victim knows -- in the same state where the body borrows born people in their bodies .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . in rough said , these are from each other as far from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome . we broke it up with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very sophisticated graphs here .
and that &apos;s why , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and that &apos;s why investment is not that clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there are people in the rich world looking at ipccc and saying , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
margaret mead , who said great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that as we move towards a thread , unstaggered , generic world view , we would see not only the entire range of human imagination reduced in a finite mindset , but one day we would have been waking up from a dream , and forgotten that there have ever been any possibility .
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , photosynthetic technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
in other words , sugar pills , in some studies , have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , only because the person thinks about what &apos;s happening to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in pain management , for example , if the patient believes only enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
if one is no said no , the vetopcca , which has completely crushed you , and i &apos;ve been struggling with whether i &apos;ve taken my great engineering degree maybe really to a bleak thing , because all my father &apos;s colleagues have always talked to him , you &apos;ve taken the money out to your kid &apos;s window .
it means that a little child in the adolescence grows up believing the mountain is an apu-spirit that determines his destiny , will become a different human , and will have a different relationship with this resource or this place , as a little child in montana who grows up believing that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be dismissed .
i had such a encounter recently , when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who is now over 90 , but had been poet throughout her life , and she told me that when she was working out on the fields in rural virginia , she said she could feel and hear how a poem about the landscape came up on her .
usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful new technologies that have come up will be , and i thought , since i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s going on here with these incredible leaps forward , which happen so fast that we can barely mimic .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interactions of our interactions with real objects -- along with my professional teacher , patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder : what if we could use computers , instead of using a mouse pointer , who moves like a digital fingertip on a flat surface ... what if we could intervene with both hands and grab data physically , and grab data as they could .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this , in my talk , in the sense that the properties and the capabilities that we &apos;ve come from the vot age of the vocabulary , which has kind of devastated us a little bit , in the machine age , that can be re-activated with the help of what we call cyber age , and that in this way , we &apos;re not actually coming back to the future about complex , technological new products , new products , but actually come back to our roots .
at this point , jafour said to octavio , &quot; what happens if we take an unfinished area of our country -- what if we just put them in a message -- a part of the american embassy , a part of the canadian embassy -- and then when people want to work under the canadian rules or the united states , they can work there , and can they do everything on the surface of this messages that usually you would have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
the young acolyths are separated at age three and four years from their families and in a shaped world of finstars , in stone huts at the time of the glaciers for 18 years . two times of every nine years , selected to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they spent in their bodies &apos; lap , now they spend metamorphorically in the lap of the great mother .
i want to end with a poem written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century that my friend jacques dembois told me about . and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot; &quot; &quot; every child , not the god of the name , not the god of the commandments , but the god who only knows four words and repeatedly , only always says , &quot; come dance with me . &quot;
when someone has taken a struggle and commissioned all of these sacred people and shared them with whom you are all , my photo will suddenly be attracted by the notre dam cathedral to all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this room , into these metaverses that use other people , and thus make a kind of a broad model of social experience with other people .
of course , a huge success story , but again , we &apos;ve got the problem of a growing company , and then we &apos;ve got two-thousandth , a small group , decided we &apos;re going to start small again and go back and dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , and this is what i think is going to be like , again , it &apos;s the same crazy thing , which is that again , people say , what should be the squeeze , this is not all about , we &apos;re talking about storage .
so that the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to make mistakes that make people inevitable , and it also enables people to create loving , supportive spaces in which anyone who observes health care can actually address things which are possible mistakes and should even reward them , and should be specifically rewarded for people like me who make mistakes and the grace of that rewards .
there &apos;s not a lot of space going on in the malaria plate of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still , through time and ritual , form a mysterious nimbus of the earth that &apos;s not based on the idea of being aware of it , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist in itself , because it &apos;s embedded in human consciousness .
i even discussed with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who introduced the psychedelic eyerea to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 300s , and i suggested that you couldn &apos;t believe these tryptamins as hallucinogens , because the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re no longer there to experience a hallucination .
many of you will know the story , because from steves articles about it , a book that was filmed back then , with robert downey junior when steve lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the contrist who studied at juilliard-conservatory , whose promising career was broadly ending early through his paranoid schizophrenia .
for example , women who pointed out the right to vote , the concept of founding fathers , which says that anatomical communality is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we have a uterus and eggs as a difference is not significant enough that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to have the right to own the right to own the right to own , etc . &quot;
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents are using foreign providers like gmail because they know that they can trust more than local providers , and that they &apos;re encrypted over ssl-connects , so the local government can &apos;t sniff around in their conversations .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who have to do with nasa and sit at nasa &apos;s expertise and plan real space missions , and they go to russia , and they go through the mission of biomedical protocol all around and on it , then fly to the international space station and take our three-dimensional camera stems .
in my show , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would be showing everyone from the rescue assistant to the bodiologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;m showing the microphone to him .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the weakness glass , and all the printing around , all the technology , and the difficulties , the human performance , if you &apos;re working on lake , &quot; you just can &apos;t explain it to others . it &apos;s like policemen or soldiers who have gone through something together and know that they can never explain it to anybody .
and wherever you look around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not denied to the demise . these are dynamically living peoples whose existence is denied by visible forces that go beyond their capacity of adaptation , whether it &apos;s the extraordinary deforestation in the homeland of penetrating , a nomatoid people from southeast asia , a people from sarawak , a people who live in the forest in the forest in the forest in now living in necessity and propagation at the river , that they can see where the toxic contaminants are ready to be lowered by the islands of japan .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content to make it realistic for them , and they actually live their real lives without oil . so , if they complain to play , they tell us where they live . and then they get news movies in real time showing them how much oil costs , which is not how much food is impaired , how much transportation is impaired , whether schools are closed , whether there must be up . and then they figure out how they really live their lives would be true , and when we ask them to ask them videos , or ask them to ask them to take pictures .
what ayahuasca makes so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this preparate , but the processing is made up of two sources . it &apos;s really made up of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane , which is a series of betakarboline , harmin , harmolin , slightly hallucinated . this climbing plant alone is about as if a blue droplet is on her consciousness , but it &apos;s being put on the leaves of a tree of a coffee called the plant called &quot; psychotridis . &quot;
simply knowing that jaguar shame still goes beyond the milky way , or the importance of the myths of the oldest of the inuit still matters , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist are still pursuing the breath of the dharma , means calling themselves the central openness of anthropology , which is the idea that the world in which we live , does not exist in a perfect sense , but only as a model of a certain set of possibilities that are successful in our own generations .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan in the woods of borneo , or the voodoo acolyths in haiti , or the warriors in the caisutti desert of northern kenya , the curanderos in the adventures , or a caravan sermon in the middle of the sahara . this happens to be the colleague that i traveled to the desert a month ago , or even a sheep shepherd on the top of qolma , the mother of the world .
how can i talk about the connection between women in 10 minutes , between three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness , in the lives of a four-year-old girl , when she passed away over 30 years ago with her little sister , mother and grandmother , five days and nights ago , sitting together in a small boat in the chinese sea . an interconnectedness that was stuck in the lives of this little girl , and never stopped -- this little girl who lives in san francisco now talking to her today ?
of course , from the medical standpoint of view , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visual disability , knee joints from titan and artificial hip joints for aging bodies that allow people to really take all of their possibilities and beyond the limitations that allowed them to develop their natural destiny , not to even speak about social networking platforms , enable people to give themselves an identity in their own way , in their own way , in the world , to orient themselves to the groups that are searching themselves .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjectively : &quot; crashed , helpless , useless , destroyed , destroyed , mutilated , wounded , threatened , discarded , discarded , balanced , impotent , paralyzed , paralyzed , bordit senil , weak , out of which transportation , repaired , broken , broken , neglected , neglected , reject , injured and useless .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , i think , defended , when he defused the useless experiments of his teaching , was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind than to assume that our scientific beliefs are endless , that there are no mysteries in nature that our triumpies are tedious , and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
and we do a series of trips to the ethnosphere where we take our audiences to places like this , of cultural wonder , that they can find a way of steering from the blessed , and hopefully , one after another , they will take the central revelation of anthropology : that this world has deserved to exist in a number of ways that we can find a way of living in a truly multicultural pluralistic world where the wisdom of all human beings can contribute to our well-being .
one of them is taken by the great selection of different salad ressings , when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and which salatdressing is already perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what has happened has this artificially imagined alternative that you regret the decision , and that regret is negatively affecting the happiness that you made of your decision , even if it was a good decision .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they suddenly get taken out one day , and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun is beginning to shine on the tracks of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in abstract confirms . and the priest is coming back and saying , &quot; do you really see ? you really like i told you .
what was really extraordinary to me was that he &apos;d collected newspaper clips of all of my childhood , whether i &apos;d won this cuts at a letter competition in the second grade , whether i &apos;d been on the parade with hallocar finders , whether i &apos;d been on my scholarship or one of my athletic settlements , and he &apos;d been using these clips to teach his students , hmedical students from the hahmedical school and the s.u.
and if you have people in front of you who are the solid persuasion , they have a soul , or you can also say , who believe they &apos;ve been brought from the soul to life , they think of it as sort of as if the soul were such a violin framework about them , not from matter , not from matter , but from meat and blood themselves , a little bit of stone , a sort of creature , to the earth of inherent , inherent , insignificant , irrelevant , yes .
