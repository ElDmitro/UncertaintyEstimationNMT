something like that .
thank you .

yes ?
yeah .
yes ?
that &apos;s hard .
you need time .
and he says ...
is that all of them ?
this is fast going on .
that &apos;s not ...
1.5 million .
we were poor .
music as a language .
yeah . okay .
i &apos;m tom .

that was us .
... not yet .
thank you .
great trick ?
from seattle ...
a few less .
ta-da !
yeah , hello .
oh my god .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re singing .
what does that mean ?
solar is ...
what does that mean ?
it &apos;s interesting .
we know that .
that &apos;s wrong .
we love innovation .
hold twice .
after a week .
thank you .
thank you .
maybe not .
positive .
thank you .
thank you .

thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
that &apos;s all about it .
seriously .
one ?
is that possible ?
well , yeah .
that &apos;s true .
this is what you can do .
thank you .
ban is blank .
what did they do ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
a few more .
pretty good , right ?
it &apos;s generic .
i was amazed .
so they knew everything .
1,000 , very good .
nothing is happening at all .
incredibly exciting .
so they meet al .
very different term .
it &apos;s essential .
he opens the door .
that &apos;s efficient .
what &apos;s happened here ?
robert gupta .
oh , so that one .
they have similar principles .
why no longer live ?
sounds familiar , what ?
thank you very much .
they &apos;re all important .
good work ! yes !
what do you say then ?
this is already happening .
that was fascinating .
the farm is incredible .
that &apos;s terribly important .
not very sustainable .
hey , why not ?
completely inefficient .
tell them .
that &apos;s actually me .
wonderful , huh ?
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much .
and she did .
what a fish .
i don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t happen .
we &apos;re going to take off .
we love entertainment .
oh my god !
i don &apos;t know .
but it &apos;s there .
does that sound good ?
a lot .
that was incredible .
we lose them .
i can help .
it &apos;s terrible .
fantastic , right ?
the sun is going up .
no hospital either .
thank you .
yes , in a way .
thank you . thank you !
three out of 10 .
stephen watts .
long , yes .
the only chance .
home where ?
yeah , that &apos;s what you can do .
because you know what ?
what do these people need ?
how interested they are .
let &apos;s call it don .
so how does this work ?
we can do it differently .
these days are over .
bg : thank you .
and i was an artist .
how do we know this ?
i have a question .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i don &apos;t think so .
can we change it ?
not very often happens .
what is media today ?
i thought about it .
i was facing him .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
so they do that .
here &apos;s an example .
so let &apos;s see .
it &apos;s not a country .
not school management .
that would have been okay .
so where do we go ?
so it &apos;s true .
you can go in .
this is the last one .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
this is our present .
this is a wish .
what &apos;s happened here ?
i &apos;m interested in all of this .
can i be honest ?
and that &apos;s important .
yeah , good day .
yeah , good day .
lento , slowly .
it has sensors .
we can do that .
just do your job .
centers were built .
there is no normal .
this was the result .
you could see manhattan .
but you know what ?
this is the system .
these people make money .
all the environmental discussion .
flying cat .
why do we do that ?
they use their hands .
i don &apos;t know .
yeah , i know .
and it has to go back .
what was the result ?
that &apos;s very good .
reevaluate them .
but you know what ?
yes , milliseconds .
here &apos;s the video .
players don &apos;t sit around .
what creates the illusion ?
the data came in .
there &apos;s no food .
but it didn &apos;t have that .
here &apos;s another example .
i created one .
and so it was .
but it gets worse .
it keeps you fresh .
an enormous challenge .
here you see it now .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
yeah . all right .
after just one journey there .
people were playing crazy .
but the wrong things .
there are online criminals .
there &apos;s an old study .
there were remixes .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
some have come and left .
that &apos;s a great question .
he always pointed back here .
imagine the camera .
he loved it very much .
let me summarize .
and then it became international .
good afternoon , everybody together .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
does anybody see anything that was particular ?
thank you very much .
here you see the city .
again , my gut feeling .
i swear it .
and i understand that .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
it feels great .
i wonder .
thank you for listening .
why should we do that ?
thank you .
they even hurt .
i hire kids .
i &apos;m a writer .
it &apos;s against justice .
jk : both .
first of all , limited .
maybe 10 times as many of you .
be a mentor .
oh . a moment .
what do you want to do ?
or before bombs .
so she was back .
this is what &apos;s happening to us today .
let me tell you .
okay . thank you .
we need energy miracles .
why does this happen at all ?
i &apos;m going in here .
there are two possibilities .
but i kept working .
not toxic in there .
you see it immediately .
and i kept working .
am i going to like the color ?
it has billions of them .
who will make it secure ?
is that your opinion too ?
ooh , thank you .
privacy must be given .
my name is amit .
they look like this .
don &apos;t be disheartened .
and a lot of people forget this .
they were still fish .
what would be done ?
i don &apos;t think so .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s called paul offit .
i felt really good .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
let &apos;s call it don as well .
i grew up in india .
so what happened years after that ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
how do we actually work for people ?
the only country in the world .
give pee a chance .
this is the short run .
so , what does that mean ?
but where are we useful ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
that &apos;s not true of emotion .
the work of interpreting it .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
in china , it was different .
we have three main groups .
but this is not protected .
it &apos;s not our problem .
i mean the soul .
okay , a few more .
is it even photography ?
i &apos;ll never forget .
it &apos;s not our fight .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
very expensive real estate .
and then it happened again .
that &apos;s a great question .
thankfully not , yes ?
dk : 60,000 .
i totally agree with you .
but there &apos;s something else .
here &apos;s another example .
we &apos;ve lost touch .
that &apos;s what she did secretly .
almost identical structure .
you hire comparison .
and why is that ?
he had had the experience .
it would be intolerable .
and that &apos;s what i always had .
yes , here it is .
ohhh .
crisis . death . disaster .
just keep on . lots of fun .
and it got better .
the answer to that is no .
but what do your fish eat ?
the orange tractor .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
very scary .
they called me the two .
external technology .
these changes are coming .
what actually happened there ?
but i felt worse .
but the crucial thing is ...
how about fitness ?
here &apos;s how it works .
and then they set it up .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
or is it possible ?
they didn &apos;t have books .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
conflict comes creativity .
this is felix .
i can say anything .
we &apos;re too many .
it would be unknown .
we were 20 people .
it may sound silly .
you can &apos;t have bones .
i &apos;ll get to the end .
this is what the chart looked like .
what else can we do ?
what is the soul ?
we don &apos;t produce ourselves anymore .
so what do we need to do ?
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
and this opens a map .
now , what does that mean ?
i was devastated .
you see the water coming .
first we have the population .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
... invent his own story .
is it about light ?
i want to ask you something .
we need to spread the message .
this is preconceived .
so what do you think happened now ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i had a good life .
who are these relatives ?
the game is from 2007 .
his name is tempt .
he went up and down .
this sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;re constantly bumping each other .
that &apos;s kind of it .
is it going to be my size ?
but what do we do with this ?
most of you know that .
you see that down there .
we love technology and creativity .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
what do i look at ?
why not think about it that way ?
you also have to understand that .
actually , i made two mistakes .
they saw the big impact .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
she shares her experiences with others .
i only loved two .
so it &apos;s n circle .
think about your own decisions .
and it took 18 months .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
this is what happened at christmas .
thank you for your attention .
this is such a natural thing .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
i see this plussical sign .
well , let &apos;s want that one .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
it should still be working .
how many people would choose creativity ?
it &apos;s not our burden .
you can have that cloud .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
and there are hundreds of them .
it was my first sunburn .
her mother pulled her on her own .
the answer is no .
the data had not been available before .
is that reasonable ?
that &apos;s how you feel . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
it was a huge success .
tell me about this world .
one place is south korea .
so anyway , you know .
now , why is this hacking ?
again , here you have it again .
they want to feed the world ?
first extension , second extension .
that was the beginning of the journey .
this is from this place .
and finally , epic meaning .
my wife told me .
but it was very sad .
let &apos;s face it -- who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
well , i was the next .
the same thing , just bigger .
they really loved it .
she connected these two people .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
and it worked very well .
and how did that feel ?
and then everybody went down .
sometimes i push too much .
i wanted to support them .
the answer is yes .
because that &apos;s what you can train .
i was grappled .
what is this thing ?
does it be curious ?
this is very risky .
but they do the job .
and this is the crux .
they could have done better .
the power plant can explode .
no one has ever said this before .
so not like detox .
but you know what ?
what should our testimony look like ?
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
the whole building was made of water .
they create an epic story .
everybody needs a gold glass .
and it was an incredible experience .
but there are two problems with this .
the story is not over yet .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
my name is brian goldman .
they can play with different kinds of things .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and then something weird happened .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
this was very grandiose .
i talk a lot about these questions .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
they have so much insecurity .
and of course , the incredible job is this .
how can we help you ? &quot;
basically they do the same thing .
and then we did that .
play doesn &apos;t mean just kids &apos; games .
the white lines are population .
what other brands are doing this way ?
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and there &apos;s good news .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
is this all education ?
she was back and she was dying .
they come from artists .
i learned everything memorized .
this is a game for outside .
but it &apos;s not going so fast .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
now , how did this happen ?
again , he was chasing him .
for example , that perception in context .
so let me remind you .
people were still happy .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
what happened that day ?
they always say , why ?
does anybody know what that is ?
that made me really sad .
this is god , you know ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
no had never been a chance .
he actually collected fish .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
play is not silly .
so they saw something magical .
so , we can do that .
so that &apos;s the good news .
it was just not invented yet .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
she did it for three years .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
2.5 to one , great .
the data always demonstrates that .
this has the biggest impact .
and so we &apos;re too many .
they can &apos;t store energy .
slowly but surely it was .
and the shape plays a role .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
my second mistake was worse .
we &apos;re not going to go any further than that .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
we all love baseball , right ?
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
every waste is nutrients .
because does anybody have masses here ?
they become free to computers .
then i can translate the whole thing .
once upon a time , we started a vivid .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
it &apos;s getting more and more similar to them .
creativity had to hold out somehow .
asked the nurse about it .
i shouldn &apos;t probably do that .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
because i can say everything .
so the question is : how ?
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
and it starts with a doctor .
this is all metadata .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
okay , that makes a really courage .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , doesn &apos;t it ?
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
and that &apos;s what we record .
what lessons did we learn ?
that &apos;s it , quite simply .
let them be sini . &quot;
i cook almost never with it .
he doesn &apos;t have that soul .
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
which would you like the most ?
so paul is a terrorist .
i started to feel better .
an autistic student .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
italy wins . yeah .
doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
and this was 19 years ago .
take nothing for granted .
in the morning , before the game .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
he pointed to the algae .
and already you have a problem .
it &apos;s not supposed to suffer other things .
and then realizing it .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
there are four and a half thousand people .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
now this is one of the images .
it just doesn &apos;t work technologically .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
we depend on two countries .
and here &apos;s the representation again .
we went to an area .
all of this today is easy .
so i just started playing .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
i like things that are different .
and this video is in real time .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
it &apos;s not documented .
this is not how you can do something from nothing .
and that really changed the dynamic .
i went to jail -- difficult .
that &apos;s like talking learning .
do you want to ensure jeans with holes ?
the game starts -- silence .
the truth is more like this .
so the correlation is small .
and that &apos;s in the very beginning .
have you ever been envy ?
and then we said , okay .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
we say sustainability in germany .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
it can know where we are .
how did he feel ?
it &apos;s spreading fast .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
because to me , it means memory .
what about longevity ?
they sell certificates .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
and do you know what i learned ?
all adults were aware of the risks .
this is completely trivial .
let &apos;s have that quiet .
why did i go to medicine ?
what else is risky ?
thank you for your patience .
now i was trying a little bit more exciting .
but very effective , yes ?
her family gathered up .
next , nuclear energy .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is scary .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
that sounds terrifying .
the movement to write it .
what is a story about ?
anyway , not to navigate .
so , see what happens .
i &apos;m going through my head a little bit .
just be who you are .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
i remember my first fire .
nullemissions , right ?
dark urin . dark .
but we need that overall .
hmmm , my brand ?
as soon as the judge saw me ?
so i went to the court .
i got a little scared of technology .
we can &apos;t do it simple .
this is what i &apos;m going to show you now .
i really wanted to be normal at the time .
you can do this all the time .
if you come up with that , right ?
it seemed pretty popular .
but the truth is far from it .
and that can make a big difference .
so we measured its movement .
they are an inspiring personality .
sunlight and co2 are a way .
i stop there , thank you very much .
anyway , we need a solution .
so it &apos;s right in the middle .
and these are neural structures .
how far do you even get there ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
on the book and on the image .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
it makes leukemia in kids .
but it requires a lot of planning .
now i see greg lemond .
okay , you really want to know ?
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
for one year we didn &apos;t have a cents .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
we started this 15 years ago .
this is the minimum .
five million people use it every month .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
they flew the canals .
that has nothing to do with science .
and yet , it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
we can regain our nutrients .
you can show i was there .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
do we really want to go this way ?
i find them disgusting .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
music is medicine . music is changing to us .
he can only use his eyes .
that has to be the difference of aging .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
you see something fun there .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
do you know what it &apos;s tired ?
they were genetically expressed .
this is a picture of the object .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
this picture reminded me of something .
and there are several reasons for this .
i really like beautiful clothes .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because we live on a water planet .
privacy is not a debate .
lego made it possible for everybody .
these will be irresistible .
baseball is full of great statistics .
oh , my time has been over ?
something got inside me .
so the first step to an interpretation .
i could draw . i could paint .
i fell in love with this fish .
it &apos;s all about changing standards .
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
we can reinvent everything again .
who do you really want to inform with this ?
my brother stared at me .
we need to think about what brands are .
a has these benefits and these risks .
just in a simple way , this is how it &apos;s going to come .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
we didn &apos;t write that app .
the stones are colored .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
a billion people are going to starve today .
no , no , it can &apos;t .
bjdorn sundin .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
who could have predicted all this ?
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and it &apos;s related to phosphorus .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of procedures .
oh my god . oh my god .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
and that got me so messed up ...
i call this the bright tiger .
it &apos;s about divorce .
here &apos;s olive oil going on .
often in the third one , forgot again .
they even bring in funding .
i learned this from my grandmother .
the defeat would have been too simple .
these rivers are rapidly accepted .
that was more to concrete .
he was six .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
and this sounds very different from before .
this is affecting the memory basin .
it was a pretty fond project .
this is a very sensitive question .
and the goal here is very simple .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier kids ?
and every morning , i jumped on it .
who would ever want one ?
here he &apos;s leaving the sun .
i want to prove that to you .
but then they really want deep inside .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
we &apos;ve won some prizes .
so this crazy story could be true .
i &apos;ll put my sleeping back .
our magazines are read by millions .
no , i mean it really seriously .
i hold the knife in my hand .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
and what does that mean to the designer ?
we need to increase complexity slowly .
they want to orient themselves in the museum ?
i started with my usual talk .
her father died shortly after birth .
here &apos;s her march gang .
and i had to get out of the city .
this is ideology , not science .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
i &apos;d written these crazy things .
completely targeted to a particular target .
he died , broken through history .
here &apos;s how the building works .
so this is a tough nose .
they went through each other .
it will deeply touch it .
they kept us from being inspired .
tell them what they feel .
i hope you forgive me .
i hire people in death cells .
they brought their pictures , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
let &apos;s start with perceiving .
now we saw the reverse effect .
so there are two cycles that come out .
we &apos;ve put unique elements in here .
that sounds kind of unusual for the first time .
and here you already feel it .
these things are logically correct .
this is what i thought was going on for energy .
all of these generations take only a few milliseconds .
students are divided by grades .
they &apos;re very good at this .
the question is , what &apos;s going on here ?
it &apos;s interested in fire .
and he signed up .
here you have this little mechanism .
let &apos;s make a little intersection .
i tried to understand them .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
it &apos;s been longer than these two networks .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
the film hasn &apos;t been released yet .
they &apos;re called projectors today .
i talked a lot about magic .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
as we think from north , we think .
they gave her blood pressure up .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
these are the apsaras .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
this may be broadcast publicly .
that &apos;s how natural things are imagined .
automatically , it walks to the right thought .
i started an institute on this .
people over the urine .
and nobody seems to get upset about that .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes something .
the other one had huge diarrhea .
in what words would you describe ban ?
if you haven &apos;t heard it before .
the living ones give rise to the spirits .
there are also world records .
fantastic ! this machine &apos;s pretty loud .
we &apos;ve reached some kind of equilibrium .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
thank you , but the best part is still coming .
happy productivity . fantastic !
the result of that was catastrophic .
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ?
how would you describe your brand ?
but with the right design , here we go .
we also got very accurate data .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
something very strange happens here .
we can support them to be good .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
let &apos;s think about atoms .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
it was truly profound .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
this is a painting of a circle .
the roof was also covered with water .
you first see from the back to the front .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
but i kept asking myself these questions .
this is also a paradigm shift .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
this is not usually the route .
this is the system we live in .
even cats look at this video .
you should also want some .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
and women did it successfully .
we can support them to be good .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
... so means , not so optimistic .
these are all interintuitive questions .
they literally flipped the lever around .
so i followed my gut feeling .
we worked at night until late .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
the drives just belong to our lives .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
lead maybe some mutations .
the next product is clean water .
he removed to silence .
now look at this curve .
everybody , politely , applauded .
so scott gets this anesthesia .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
it has been constant .
they have them . they always have them .
especially if it &apos;s died already .
we go through initiation rituals .
we &apos;re talking about it in ambiguity .
a dalmatiner , right .
the main man pushed me up .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
it &apos;s about a recovery of america .
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
he turns off the power plants .
and curiosity can &apos;t be learned .
so from modern to computer society .
there was jimmy kimmula coming .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
it may take time for it to be invited .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
i lived in parallel worlds .
you can be logical and intuitive .
not even the truth will release it .
maybe i did it well .
someone made an old-fashioned version of it .
so the first exciting primate .
and that was the outbreak .
and also these sources underlie interruptions .
maybe even have to look back at that again .
we now have masses in this country .
the bank is from another place .
that &apos;s such a tangible part .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them out . &quot;
and this picture was taken by atlas .
no , no , far missing .
also , dosification plays a role .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
i learned a few very simple things .
tell me a little bit about that part .
to say , what is information ?
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
everybody would like to make people happier .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
these kinds of things don &apos;t exist with us .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
156 nations send our tv channel .
we can give ourselves something like this .
the chef had cooked it .
we need to get far , fast .
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
this is going to happen in the next april .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
i see the dalmatiner .
what takes five milliseconds ?
they &apos;re someone &apos;s home countries .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
they had a concept of blue blood .
tempt is now completely paralyzed .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
they tap into their internet connection .
but today we are way beyond that .
i thought everybody could do that .
he shaped his head , no .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
the thing that &apos;s just been represented .
make it possible -- all of you here .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
and why ? genetically modified food .
daniel kahneman : sure .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people later .
so there is a feedback .
so littalive &apos;s open source .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and there are quite a lot of collaborators .
and i want to read them to you .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
does anybody even know what that is ?
this is an ecological network .
you put your box down like this .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
this is an annual diving river .
i think our identity is threatened .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
they lead the process , they understand it .
now the next step is happening within these communities .
it all comes from our own pockets .
my cousins were walking all over the place .
it was a grouper .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
bad ? i was completely confused .
alone , shamed and without help .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
i get tired , like all of us .
let &apos;s pull out something else now .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
it should hold the two elements again .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
and anyway , italy ended up winning .
but the game is a formal transducer .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
as an artist , i &apos;m really interested in the relationship .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
a language is expression of the human mind .
this is just an insurance method .
shake the environment , make less waste .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
it can know how we hold it .
we get an absolutely flat line of this .
thank you , danny kahneman .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
his personal impressions of the seaeroses .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
this is a modest little app .
there &apos;s never been a time like this before .
it &apos;s called &quot; jump with me . &quot;
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
they grew up five centimeters .
here are two different jewelry plants .
you see the timeline on the top .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
and then what do you do with the garbage ?
there &apos;s a lot of stuff that needs to come together .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it &apos;s a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
i &apos;m going to try this through an unprecedented one .
that &apos;s what he has to process first as a present .
i have it on my laptop here . &quot;
and then he can walk off .
all of a shells of cool whip eat .
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine mozart efficiently .
and then it usually looks like this .
so , help me a little bit about this .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
they make us feel worse about us .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
so , that was my primary motivation .
we wondered , and nobody knew .
monday : color is something powerful .
do you remember the winkfold again ?
man 3 : i &apos;m the museum guy .
or take a lip pen .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m there .
by now , the instruments have evolved .
the amount of water was expanding .
second half-time . end of the normal game time .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
so what are archaic models ?
if you burn natural gas , no .
everyone &apos;s eaten cake .
if you burn coal , no .
it kind of wired us up .
say there are no forecasts .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
and you can continue the list endlessly .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
three paragraph you know from high school .
in fact , i didn &apos;t want to make a viral video .
i want to explain that a little bit for a second .
yes . it does nothing but discover .
in this three-sentence , there are three sentences .
it just didn &apos;t occur , you know ?
this is my supermarket . this is not a big market .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
this is one , a part of her .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
that really solves the fuel problem .
and it was a catastrophic disaster .
but western governments also help themselves .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a second .
here you see roberto dancing .
that &apos;s just the work title , by the way .
thank you . i have a question for you .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
there are lots of great books on this topic .
the emergency staff was moving all the strands .
so far , this has been a problem for supercomputers .
and on , you see it all the time .
so basically , a translation of translation .
no insurance can make up .
what are i applying for ?
it &apos;s great that number is going up .
so what can we conclude from all of this ?
you can predict that . why is that ?
isn &apos;t it enough to cut half or a quarter ? &quot;
no tree is carbon neutral .
in two hours , it &apos;s refining everywhere .
you just listen , and then you start talking .
we still think they &apos;re original .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
life had not changed for centuries .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
and the two more recent ones are here today .
my grandmother never forgot me his life .
the official dogma of what ?
if not , squawk somebody else today .
and let me show you a simple example .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
my parents are the 80 on the heels .
if you think about it a little further now .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
i work in the solar technology industry .
i said , &quot; ok , oma . &quot;
well , i went to the court .
the three words were : do you remember ?
we refuse genetically modified food .
they can dive in one year .
they laughed more than you do here .
because that &apos;s all evidence , right ?
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
donnerday : confidence is the key .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
it captures mosquito thousands of square kilometers .
we &apos;ve forgotten them . puff .
i tried to preserve the body .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
i wanted to restore the health of a disease .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
it &apos;s a game called folc .
we think of energy nowadays .
that &apos;s what the norm says about it .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
people suffered . people fought .
can you also play them in blue now ?
so , that really blew my mind .
raise your hands . let me see .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
imagine that for a moment .
it &apos;s actually not much better .
maybe we can think of the drives as a change .
you can zoom in very easily and out of it .
no , we realize what &apos;s inside of it .
let me show you how they work .
shake the environment , consume less energy .
but it has an unexpected twist .
my fourth technique : the requirement of complexity .
now you see the dalmatiner .
you can jump directly to a certain output .
three : escalation of expectations .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
i thought i could integrate .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
i call it the &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
keep america new . find out more .
you go around and amuse yourself .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and this is a million-dollar concert .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
and this is very important in medical research .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
then he whispered in my ear .
so again , that fit really well together .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
we &apos;re hoped we don &apos;t need that .
so that made sense , it fit together .
anyway , they do it in there .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
and if not , still dance .
let me show you from near .
what would you say to someone who thinks that ?
shame . shame .
and in time , they can react again .
this is alfred gonzalez .
this must be down here , down to zero .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
there &apos;s a lot of luck coaching .
so at this point we need digital security systems .
and here &apos;s every piece that &apos;s very well planned .
we need to be interested in more research funds .
there can be a series of changes .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
what ? that really freaked me out .
yet , we seem to be quite pleased with this .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition point .
intersexuality occur in many different forms .
but i didn &apos;t discourage from that .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
now i added a barrel .
your problem is you &apos;re too little .
no one has to give their ideas green light .
the permanent ice is marked with red .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
third technique : categorization .
but so many got help over the years .
this is called the osite model .
it was something we knew to do .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
they were just like the people in this room .
and yes , i &apos;ll go on a slide again .
what do you do with certificates ?
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
so put them out ; save your shoes .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i think i may have heard more hands .
seriously -- the decline is expanding !
our goal was to say , okay .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s inside of it that &apos;s useful .
scott was talking about human beings .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is like .
is it about the details or the colors ?
the question is , why do people accept that ?
and they had to remove what we were doing .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
first of all , i thought this was a game .
and every night they fly back 240 kilometers .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
it has a button on , on / off .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
that &apos;s why i think we must be leaders .
they live with chemosynthesis help .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and silicon .
at first we just signed up .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re dolphins .
what do you think the answer will be ?
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masses .
every morning , they fly to the farm 240 kilometers .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
and try this again with another generation .
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
it &apos;s the way i like to be .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
on the left you see a little boat .
what is the food production ? &quot;
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back who had no childhood .
these things have a more positive effect .
let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t put them wrong .
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here .
well , this cartoon makes a few statements .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
so two couples , each one is a baby .
picasso says , just wait .
they &apos;re all back on their way .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
the first one is a classic , apple .
and i went back to work .
usually i would take out the needle .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
this is exactly balanced in china in a second .
what we want is to create the future .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
and we continue to increase our expectations all the time .
all of these are composable .
this becomes a key element of this stuff .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
natural light then offers smart-grid .
next week it comes to the market .
today , a lot of people have given up to the government .
no one in the world has done that yet .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
i was completely excited about science , you know .
now i &apos;m going to do some more stuff about this .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demonstration .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
storytelling needs more and more senses .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
anyway . i certainly want that .
technical cycles are the same way .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
there are some very interesting developments .
and everything is packaging or content .
and still maintain a realistic level .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
so don &apos;t save , forget , avoid .
and we still need to improve a lot on this device .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge to offer that for nine .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
so each concert is a different concert .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of the five .
so smart grid , huge topic everywhere .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we don &apos;t get an identity ; we invent it .
it was a lot of off , and i was in eile .
i got it very well here .
at first , tribal society through language .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to the human .
that would roll on the land .
now everybody from this pattern is trying to see something .
he came up to me and hugged me .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you for a moment .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
all of them who were like this began to divide .
i &apos;m really sorry . is this crazy ?
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
this is a problem many players have .
i want to show you something too first here .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
do you know what you call a 400,00th ?
i don &apos;t want to do anything different in life .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i didn &apos;t want to leave ; i love my life .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
what &apos;s happened is we &apos;ve been able to do that .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
the best part is still -- in a second .
i start with some simple examples .
when i was 16 , i started illustrating books .
and i have to say , it gave me power .
it supports some of the mistakes it &apos;s talking about .
and of course , it then clicked .
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
i put them in treatment , and i went to my treatment .
and we want to make this material available to everybody .
so to the point of the day , financial saving .
notice two things on this curve .
they don &apos;t invest time in power fights .
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and i &apos;d like to suggest that that &apos;s good .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
for example , the sneaker , right ?
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
this is how they communicate -- this is how their fingers walk along .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
we want to do something about death penalty .
i &apos;m wearing jeans almost all the time .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
all of this summarizes up are errors inevitable .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
but maybe you can still agree with them .
both of them are superstible , both of them are alive .
as i said , amanda is our elephant .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
the silence is ocar-numbing .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
i was not familiar with the label .
so you don &apos;t lose animals often preceding .
so they were just tiles for him .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and we see it going through .
that means we need to get back phosphorus .
this is sort of like our fight .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
so that they can pull the whole movement .
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
here are a few more people testing it .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
there seems to be a disagreement there .
they &apos;re getting rare because we start them .
one of the things i thought he had was kidney rocks .
this is a dead turtle .
there were no cantaloupe-melons .
you saw it wardly in the news .
we &apos;ve understood that weather is global .
in the countries where people are getting money .
i have something here that i want to show you .
this is an entirely unsustainable pattern of development .
it has molecular weight of over 300 million .
so , we can &apos;t even wear these things .
store them off , dissolve the rest .
how about living longer at good health ?
and i found this incredibly exciting .
and what does it actually look like in there ?
and in that head , the memory was played off .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
they &apos;ve reversed the river of water .
all around the world , these winds are almost around .
and give back to my chief doctor .
i want to help you calm down .
we want to lower the number of prisoners .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
but what happens to citizens is different .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
did you take all your vitamins this morning ?
so that was a very strange experience .
the dedication of dna was an interesting step .
no apple ever tasted that way again .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
the only thing they had was her head .
and i become a character in the book .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i was an obsessive obsessional student .
... that the doses also matter .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
he &apos;s just deceiving you and not yourself .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence at all .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
and that wasn &apos;t a hard diagnosis .
it &apos;s sort of a behavior poop print .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
how could it be possible that we do this ?
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
she had the last word in every family conflict .
so , that &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
because the notes are the only connection directly with him .
well , really good , maybe a single star .
or they didn &apos;t have a photolitography .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
in 2010 , it had been 23 million times .
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before .
this is footage over six seconds .
i learned that , in a moment , everything &apos;s different .
the marshmallow must be on top .
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
well , i understand that . that &apos;s what i do .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
so i think the basics are very simple .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
but how do you do that in practice ?
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
do you know how many people are watching these tedtalks ?
and the answer will probably be probably no .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
so each droplet was a little bit different .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
here are the results we just got .
the u.s. drive on for hundreds of years .
i did my job at 95 kilos .
i think the first one is curiosity .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
it &apos;s not all meant to be composable .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
yes , so what &apos;s biohacking about it ?
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
and that worked . applause for scott .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
interpretation is barely talked about in early class .
look , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
good night , cute thylacine . &quot;
and all of this leads to the one big question ...
there are those that are much more spatial .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
we found that it was really strange .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
here we were , and this is the painting .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
but one of them is far worse than the other .
this is the kind of educational shame .
this is the call center for service and information .
but are we going to do the best thing in our play drive ?
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
you know , it was a trick , right ?
well , let me show you a little bit more of it .
from avian age to machine age .
it &apos;s nateness , and it &apos;s just nail .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
i had a relationship with that beauty for several months .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not perceived as a huge loss .
we want to eliminate mass arrests . &quot;
we see the same thing in the disabled movement .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
and so i made a little bit of an unusual decision .
yeah , what kind of projects are we actually doing now ?
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
we have all our navigation systems in our cars .
emc presents &quot; welcome transparency . &quot;
now we &apos;re doing this with drivers and machines .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
you do something a little bit different , actually .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
and we use this word with such a contempt .
she barely breathed , and she was walking blue .
wealth , not debt , is affecting the outcome .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
many of you probably know this trick in this room .
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success .
but let &apos;s not always have that bad thing down .
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us any money .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen that .
because we can &apos;t live without that life .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor in the scene .
i made a decision to move to the united states .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
so we have 1.5 billion players in total .
this is a game i have to say .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
if your job is dance , dance .
so my two passions kind of flew out .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
i can surround the sequence as you walk .
or are they more of a down-attribute ?
designing a phrase with your own breath .
for nathaniel , music means soul health .
i want to tell you how we found that .
there is a connection , a respect to each other .
my mother suffered from the boat &apos;s nightmare .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about reality .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
have a nice example of that .
and we &apos;re reinventing ourselves as often as we want .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the board staff anymore .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the assistant doctor .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
the main problem here is kind of like aids .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know he was here in 1835 .
and yet , we don &apos;t fully understand the possibilities of that yet .
then i say , thank you very much , right ?
these results have been achieved through several weeks of hard work .
and it was the same after the three months .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
this player is about to stand in front of an epic victory .
probably one of these numbers must get very close to zero .
... could you just just show the slide for a second ?
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much like it . &quot;
in the same way , i think we &apos;re putting in games today .
right now we are far from that goal .
let me give you an example of what i mean .
why am i doing that ? what &apos;s the result ? &quot;
and i went over and just listened .
and fortunately , there are also a lot of studies now .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
it also shows up in other places of the book .
we are all born . we are bringing children to the world .
and we want to get this to a global level .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
i &apos;ll agree first , that &apos;s logical .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
and some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t work .
if you want to make it hyperlinks between the images .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
the people in the side rooms are coming in now .
the child in me is really excited about opportunities like this .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
there &apos;s a program that some people may know .
so we &apos;re going out there , and where are we going ?
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the poker use right now .
they virtualize reality without computers .
we wanted to develop a tool for language learners .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right about ?
when i say reality , i mean photoreality .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
it seems important to me to unify both .
the dog ! i was loud in front of it .
now , do you know what the answer to this question is ?
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
a little bit more about them , which is not them .
and how did that work work for you ? what did it do ?
al is a hydrant in boston city .
but the phosphorus will not be replaced .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discovery .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
in doing so , we learn trust and the rules of the game .
and if not , then stuxnet doesn &apos;t do anything .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
they moved to a natural concept .
let me give you an analogy .
we didn &apos;t have child paralysis in this country yesterday .
this is another look at the tree of life .
and we created an ipad app .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
i think that &apos;s true for every human on the planet .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzles .
think about it . this attack is generic .
and i took a while to figure this out .
loans and sponsors were searched .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
you can look around all these museums here .
he says , &quot; get ready for jumping up . &quot;
imagine a soundless airplane .
we repeated that exercise with the same students .
&quot; look at your stomach , pink .
they shared the kingdom in two layers .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
so we start with a windows drone .
and his whole process has changed .
child mortality has declined by a tenth of a tenth .
so he got the citizens to check them .
every big picture is the beginning of a cut .
so these women met , and they just sat .
there is no overpopulation problem in trees .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
how much money is needed to realize this ?
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to all of you !
we called it the digital water of pagos .
so please listen when a music is played .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
it &apos;s hard to overestimate the destruction .
this is an idea worth spreading .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so , go ahead and start inventing them .
and we can look at that now .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
and that &apos;s the message , in n .
imagine just two other small changes .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s going on .
because they have special skills of processing .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
it &apos;s versatified and weird programs .
the second factor is the services we use .
i said , &quot; promising , oma . &quot;
go and quit leonard cohen .
that means that ants weigh a lot more than we do .
so here are some natural fireflies .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
and this changed my way of making films completely .
there are some places we can turn to .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is changing .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
but what this image says is a problem .
we can continue these things in different examples .
what we &apos;ve stayed with is the story walk .
do that once , and then you get the sentence .
this shouldn &apos;t be a joke now , but it should be a joke .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
are they eight , and they &apos;re like 007 ?
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
he described one of them as very common .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
and at all , you work much less than me .
and less usable or usable it is .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
we go to the poor of the placebo industry .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
but volumes are significantly larger than ever before .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
everybody knew your genius was a little shy .
you may have heard that we put watermarks in .
play is the tickle that keeps us together .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
and these were sort of the first of human beings developed toys .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
so the occupythesec movement did it .
but these are all roads in the u.s. .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open your doors ?
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
maniok is something that eats half a billion people .
i will never play the way i play at this moment .
that &apos;s there , then that comes back .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
you zoomed in . you can actually go in .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
so in other words , i define first what i want .
they teach them to open doors for themselves .
and i see the same process combining photographs .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
it grows in winter and shrink in summer .
we redesigned them , repaired them .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
you can move inside and experience different kinds of experiences .
saueber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
when you have something to give , now give it .
they had 348 different types of brand .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website here .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
and the world that we live in now looks like this .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
or are they more like a down attribute ?
this is the consequence we have to ask ourselves .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
it was seen almost 200 million times this year .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
he &apos;s stealing out of my mind every five days .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
we had no words for what we started there .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this is an interactive trickshot twist .
paralysis is a series of choices .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
and the film is called &quot; the me me ever . &quot;
so i say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s changing games !
well , we introduced the mayor belhole .
with pivot , they can dive in a decade .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
well , today we know all about where our things come from .
i &apos;d like to continue doing this work that i love .
i &apos;m still going to continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t confine yourself .
bg : so an energy breakthrough is the most important .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
is it serving for others , or is it affecting us ?
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital hitting the physical .
also urban designers and construction engineers are very interested .
now we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even streaming .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
and strangely ol√© ! think of it despite all of this .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
where is the biggest interest in actually doing this ?
the living self has no voice in that choice .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
we went back to the wreck of the titanic .
and do you know what my answer to all of these is ?
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation &apos;s fuels .
it &apos;s an ne form of retact , right ?
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
you get a model that emerges from all around the world .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned how to sing ?
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and alert .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot;
we should put the bear in the cage .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
zidane , at a moment of the head .
and no , it &apos;s not like a wash or a san francisco .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
because artists have a broken relationship with lies .
in one place , the screen is filled with leaves .
every society is coined by a primary medium .
this year it was seen almost 50 million times .
how can i make something useful ?
the grandfather of this old man refused to refuse .
also , the energy episode is very important for them .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
now , how do people die in the course of such a hack ?
this is my flesh , and i can flip it around .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being intelligent .
that &apos;s not how this doesn &apos;t work at all for the memory itself .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing , right ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
both of these cases woke up at me , asked me .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
i sell scholars all over the country , all over the world .
the first story about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my lap like this .
so you just go to google nuclear project.com .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same .
by the way , that &apos;s the hardest part in my talk .
this is star night , probably never seen like this before .
when we start thinking about it this way , it changes everything .
and i learned a lot in the course of this journey .
as a child , i kept drawing comic books and things like that .
i can &apos;t play the same as in 20 years today .
in both cases , they got surgery , and they were fine .
that &apos;s why thinking about how to weigh it .
i was actually obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
so when klaus says there &apos;s no soul .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re aiming at now .
many of them talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
we were only silent around the same way as we were .
a research mester on natural interface design .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
this says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
it &apos;s actually going to be more like my goggles .
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ?
the biggest difference between them is the endeavor of time .
how do you judge people based on their characteristics ?
i didn &apos;t know how to use the steam .
now it &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
as i said , two-thousand-thought just started it .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
the cell communities again began to abstract information .
well , there aren &apos;t many thousand goals in this area .
and then we &apos;re offering one of these great dunes .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; get it wrong .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
but i really believe that something else comes after us .
edward caastronova is a economist .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m going to execute it for you and then explain it .
you know nothing can do it in this goldfish glass . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
we know another one where all the gas stations are .
i &apos;m going to dissolve as well as what &apos;s in there .
what other metamorphoes have you gone through ?
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
our steps in digitizing life were exponential .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s slowing down for none of our big problems .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different once .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
the idea is to overlift a digital security system .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
have you ever seen a climattric tree ?
it was called the automatically connected stone .
what are you going to consume ? what are you praying ?
provides new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
but they can combine something special like this .
frosty , the carbon man gets cleaner every day .
we see the process that feeds itself .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
because the images really feel it for them .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
thylacine rat ? yes . alive ? yap .
diginotar is a certification site .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
he took up a famous photo . what did it mean ?
i wasn &apos;t there long ago with miguel .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
in fact , in the museum at night , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
this was not a film , no hd , this was real .
diphump , tube , child paralysis ...
but actually , that night , it was a even more fun one .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental intersection .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
and of course , how does design affect perception .
that is , that &apos;s what the crime rates go back .
it could happen within a time &apos;s learning framework .
she had suffered you with untreatable brain damage .
... it gives it to crowdsourcing .
and he was crying and saying , like this ?
they attached them to the machine of the beating .
i &apos;m here to share with you my photography .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
lawt : i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
so how does a person deal with certain things .
we have an abstract language .
all life &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
as was happening in the village earlier .
but we don &apos;t know very little about where things are going .
there &apos;s more behind it . it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
i know what people think when they see that .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivating it is .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
ask , ask , ask for evidence , ask for light .
now , winner , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
so this is what happens to this nanotyped machine age .
it was the misguided cross against drugs .
another example is what we call virtual reality .
a few years ago , i started to develop littalive .
he lived only for about 30 years .
open up the map , and jump with a click .
and my talk today is going to be mostly about these cognitive drops .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollingg &apos;s .
what is this new state that is slowly accepting the world ?
imagine these images could really start to fly .
and i don &apos;t expect that it will ever change .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
the shrimp eats the phytoplankton .
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
in 25 years , it will have gone from here to here .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
in other words , play is our adaptation joker .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
and i can tell you it was a shifting experience .
ohhhhh , wowwwww !
and even today , we still depend very , very strong on stories .
a baby needs about six thousand winds .
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
it &apos;s not just a nice soundscape .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
so , i step back and then i get the perspective .
it caused enormous july in the control room .
so , in a certain sense , technology is overwhelming us .
so we should be better off figuring out what the goal is .
but what if you want to see the paintbrush strike ?
we had to worry about lawyers and so forth .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
i was filming in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
so i know of some who didn &apos;t hire .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the years of age .
and then we did a lot of simulation .
the brochumes still describe them as untouched .
she was a gun , strong woman , she had an impact .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
that &apos;s a relatively substantial number of people around the world .
this is a variant thing done .
when we build cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
well , the energy episode has fallen over time .
they were asked to talk about their pain every 60 seconds .
it &apos;s like asking someone to hit the sun .
because the musical instrument is the expansion of our body .
my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition .
and so it escapes its agonizing conditions .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
we can actually do the same things with less energy .
it &apos;s this kind of pathetic , cost-effective taste .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
secondly , combined photos should have the same species of lighting .
and the film will be called &quot; the goal ever maker . &quot;
and we &apos;re replacing the oil with other energy carriers .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be like .
and also , what you would think of today in mind .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
and then i immediately figured out , this is unfair .
i hope you &apos;ll be happy about that . thank you very much .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you very much wish .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight this ?
i &apos;m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i &apos;m not making it . i &apos;m not making it easy .
so there &apos;s better to be a nine in the beginning of my death row .
and yes , i have a task , as you may recognize .
because they are the people who are also experts in taste .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not all yet .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdressing .
just that i think i like it more , right ?
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through masses , 20 per hour .
i mentioned this to miguel , and he was nodding .
i have that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
but can you do that if you go to an foreign ?
why do they advertise around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
what we need are a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to prefer injustice .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
50 percent of their decisions have been made in nine minutes or less .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions we need to be facing .
let &apos;s call the animal beginner , it costs a lot of money .
we also brought littlive to design schools .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing real space .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
i mean , how much do we consume from our memories ?
if one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
and as we get older , the wind gets bigger .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing going on in the movie of stats .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
this is the time you fall in love .
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it either .
in fact , we are also such a large-scale community .
we need to begin to turn the real world into a game .
for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
and the next interesting period took about one billion more years .
today i want to tell you about circles and openings .
and all of a sudden , he no longer seemed human .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to get more efficient .
each of these topics , of course , was made up of many , many smaller decisions .
and immediately i see another pattern that arises .
a few months went on , and i had just forgotten everything .
players are champions in the spider &apos;s poet of social networks .
so in the west , people have really spent a long time thinking about creativity .
that &apos;s why not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
the fact is that that uncertainty should make us worry .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
we can predict the structure and function according to its behavior .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
and i celebrate , i cry like a little child .
so that &apos;s what really got me thrown away , and i wanted more .
obviously , this is not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a moment .
my great-grandparents all died when they were 60 .
or do you want to be fitter , stronger , have more power ?
an amazing error rate . one in nine innocent .
and i don &apos;t just mean less success , even though that &apos;s part of it .
this trick you can introduce to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
one consequence of that was that the phone had never broken .
and of course , in germany , she can &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
so it became the same bad team of one of the best .
b has these benefits and these risks . what do you want to do ?
yes , this is what one of the lights down there is just the load .
that all of our survival is linked to the survival of each individual .
we &apos;ve been in holland now for over three years .
this is the audience we just finished recently .
well , your living self is not going to get happier .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of sea level , just like greenland .
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding her this morning , &quot; he said .
since that time , we &apos;ve all gotten some kind of recognition .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 if a bat hits 300 .
there are a series of photographs somewhere here -- here they are .
in 2010 , we had just joined together among two billion people online .
i studied woman printer , and she was in breathing .
we &apos;ve been moving in the age of avian before .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
and they were lighting the way through the rest of the book .
this approach is true of everything we do creatively .
the more money you earn is happier .
here &apos;s a picture of an orange in kentucky .
so the smarter the gut better the system . &quot;
and i was collecting more and more knowledge all the time .
he &apos;s got a 15 to one .
they interact with their surroundings and their experiences in a clear way .
you know , there were no mandarin in paradise .
and this video had actually been sent in january .
even if you kill someone , it &apos;s not just a murderer .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
i now know it was the reason of the sea .
i can say the chancer is a man .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
and this was the first time i learned this .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
the creation of software usually takes a few years .
and what &apos;s noticed is that i needed an expert .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
i sent her home without talking to my superdoctor .
we need to rely on government &apos;s machinery .
well , how do you begin to speak the language of music ?
because this is where the actual government work is going .
the cost of solar was down 50 percent last year .
and i think it makes it worry that the world looks like this .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is vision .
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and i convinced her to fund an expedition .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
again , what potential do we want to call ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with you .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that either . our healthcare system is mies .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is something truly fantastic .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
when it wasn &apos;t moving , they were buried .
because all these new technologies of today feed themselves .
there &apos;s a direct reference system for this .
it has moments of life , one after another .
i &apos;ll tell you what those notes might have to mean .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
the previous example was about finding detail .
some people were disappointed it was not poetry .
secondly , what economists call oppersia cost .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
the things that are only being used go into technical systems .
they did that by imposing the land .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of information overload .
it was a store called the kieter .
and then let &apos;s project this analogy into the future .
so , if you can turn that light back on , please .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire department .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
please welcome the fear . please welcome the risk .
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
bryan stevenson : well , there are possibilities everywhere
looks pretty much like old-fashioned assembly language .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
i apologize that i have to cut so much .
this is already loses half of his value in the first year .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
are they there ? they look a little nervous .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with them .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
so the device that you see has not worked .
we &apos;ve just crossed the 7-billion-dollar brand .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
we &apos;ve been used to things linear happen .
and then people could eat it and they wouldn &apos;t get blind .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as mandatory .
in there they are , they want to go to the end of the gang .
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s sure to meet four out of 10 , by the way .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a rolling iceberg .
so i want to present to you two , maybe three examples .
that &apos;s like all of you in the pre-wind period .
there &apos;s a step-step guidance there .
that keeps us at the pole , and keeps us growing .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
we &apos;ll be faced a few more days in the next few days .
this first one , this was more like a passionate monkey .
i haven &apos;t argued with my wife two years anymore .
well , the memory self is a storyteller .
i started thinking , i should just get into the project .
the pilot was making the machine out after the hudson river .
it turns out that dna synthesization is very difficult .
it was the fear of terror that formed their lives .
and it &apos;s especially the first time to ask what &apos;s the right thing to do .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
the revelation is that death is part of life .
you see the person inside of it wondering what &apos;s going on .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he deceived her .
you add a blue one to a green one , and you can make light .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
because the music is a language , and a language is there to communicate .
we think about our future as predicted memories .
and we found that there was actually a connection .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
but so far , i &apos;m just kind of curious about it .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer on themselves .
make it impossible to tell how the photo was actually put together .
but they don &apos;t notice the previous losses .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
do you know how much decisions do you make on a typical day ?
so the driving force behind this is cyber superpower .
the words , as long as his friends , now spoken to his .
i knew she &apos;d come to goodbye .
most of my activities , i have two hips .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good .
that &apos;s why they help with it , ask people about it .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
do you know how many decisions do you make in a typical week ?
a typical walmart now offers you 100,000 products .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach that .
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
which one would you like to have if it could only have one ?
so they &apos;re moving around making art installations like this .
and other examples are the ambitious , intelligent systems .
i say that because i believe identity is very important .
because their lives depended on whether they did the job right .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
i &apos;d like to suggest that we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll ask .
anyone heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
&quot; 2.5 to one what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
and then we started negotiating with the insulers .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
i went through the emergency department on my way home .
i was shocked , and i was shocked to the inside .
but also , our perception , however , is fooling us .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
when we looked at how feelings vary with income .
how many doors does the house that you live in ?
and i guess many of you have done that too .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
that &apos;s where we think of cases like diginotar .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of diginotar .
i was the only one who could talk to the airplanes .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
the most powerful miner worker is the head of massey coal .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
so when i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s what makes your interest .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
that too , so in any store , you can get things back .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
and the lives lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
think of this as a score , as a flying score .
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go to .
usually most people start to orient themselves about the task .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-book .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
you have to make 62 different decisions to completely design your car .
you can test it after my talk in your rooms .
it &apos;s almost like we are preparing our lives to do it .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the living itself .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just the way it went .
she said it would be like a thundering train of air .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos islands .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so now we &apos;ve removed the time scales .
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
am i looking like i could just write a song ?
because through marine protected areas , we basically restore the past .
if you don &apos;t do that , anybody can take it away .
but it &apos;s the sum of many ideas , of course .
it &apos;s asking the question , can you get this to zero ?
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
we know money is very important , targets are very important .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
grow up a fish , but also a bird reserve .
sometimes i lose balance . a story finally .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
has one single person in the audience ever seen anyone die of masses ?
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
i want to end with a story that really got me excited .
and online criminals &apos; motives are very easy to understand .
most of them are completely ignored by the memory themselves .
when the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
we can look at the garbage problem , of course .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to face .
so , for example , shake the environment , drive less car .
so nowadays , evolution can happen in time from microseconds .
so the question is , how do we deal with these winds ?
just to precise time points , you &apos;re agreed .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming out of our heads .
they now have a five-percent renewable energy percentage .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
you feel that &apos;s the real truth behind the outcome .
this is technology supported innovation that we have today .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma again in new york .
but while they were talking to different people in the world about these possibilities .
now he &apos;s mentioning the minerals needs of phytoplankton .
the first of these fall is a resistance to admit complexity .
so the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
we could , of course , reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
that means we &apos;re useful , we &apos;re not less harmful about it .
we produce androgen , and we respond to androgens .
and perhaps the best part of this is what we want in health .
bonobos are our closest living relatives with chimpanzees .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
i &apos;m perceiving the breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
ceos are a little bit about average , but this is where it gets interesting .
the judge thinks of him as an adult , but i see a child .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little is it supported .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the tempts room .
this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
i want to give you a particular aspect of curiosity .
you go around the block , and you take it as an epiphany .
they invest a lot of their time in assembly continually growing structures .
but i don &apos;t know how people will be peaceful .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
usually you &apos;re kind of just wrong , and some people don &apos;t .
wr wants to help people who were innocent .
if you walk , yes , every footprint destroys the ground .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple exercise .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
this is a whole book , an example of non-image data .
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death penalty .
i became the miracle part of not dying that day .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many outfits ?
let &apos;s call it miguel . it &apos;s actually called miguel .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
and then the same thing happens in a good , appropriate conversation .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes modern progress possible for us .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
if we exaggerate it , we can take a little back .
we all need to believe at the end things we can &apos;t see .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation needs .
and as a general notion , we can use the word &quot; intersexuality . &quot;
and i thought that was so difficult , so painful .
i &apos;m probably not going to be able to take all of you on this journey .
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
here he &apos;s highlighting a rare equatter .
they don &apos;t even come out of the museums , i think .
tempt will be part of the show , which has gone quite hard .
we record images of this mini-big bang in detectors .
car color , outside of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can do that .
economists call this a pareto improvement assessment .
because he doesn &apos;t know which pile he &apos;s supposed to go first to .
here &apos;s one evidence that men are not pigs , by the way .
we degrade a human worth in our society .
so maybe before the interview , you should have a little bit of this . &quot;
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come to court .
well , in fact , the number of violent crime has not changed very much .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
it means that we have a cultural impact among the scientific .
just this airport has a space of 100 square kilometers .
we &apos;re putting games in order to escape the suffering of the real world .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity , on our humanity .
so i &apos;ve been looking at this , when is of course or intuitive ?
here you see an excerpt from this fine code .
and these are just the biohackers now , the individual people .
we got his bed tilted so he can look outside .
i first eaten him in a restaurant in southern spain .
most of the fear they were in front of pirates , rape and death .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-replicating .
this actually only really only has taken two thousand times to form , which is these networks .
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
but a lot of people get caught up in a very strange position .
so this looks like a basketball playoff .
someone had broken down , and had hacked the system really thorough .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
and six million seconds , also a really exciting phenomenon .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i couldn &apos;t have failed .
from that time , an anecdote that you may know .
our gut is a wonderfully hostile environment for these bacteria .
that goes way further back into pre-industrial times cultures .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get out of all these extensions .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
imagine that every single person is being controlled .
but instead of getting to panic , he just stopped .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
if you look at the people you have to deal with ...
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
and they did it with something called lead-maps .
and guess what we found in the fine code ?
what about the contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
six : social decline . seven : 65 .
okay , so let me squeeze some blood out for you .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
and that &apos;s also what i had last half-year .
but somehow we &apos;re able to get away from this problem .
i like things that are curious . i like weird things .
turned the garbage pitch on the side . went home .
it was always so inspiring , so daunting .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
and i really want to show you my outfits this week .
here i make it a little bigger . we look right in the center .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points of imagery , i think .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
so when i was 15 , i decided to be a diver .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me like this .
fireflies in a jar , i always found quite exciting .
from my point of view , i looked up and down at the janitor .
many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
the x-ray interpretation of a piece is comparable to that .
there were gray whales there long ago -- 500 years ago .
that means that the player certainly beat three out of 10 .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer , by the way .
how about a sentence of new , never heard before ?
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view of the world .
basically , the concrete building block had become the building block of our time .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect in hollywood .
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
for example , the fish had been recorded on a glacier flight .
possibilities that had not been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
ah , the majority . i like to think of that as a doctor .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
this is , in fact , the real melting of human and machine .
there was , i think , a pretty good code there .
after all , in progression , we should welcome fear .
why is it important to start ? what is the red ?
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s back 2,500 years .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limitations .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and if they &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
i ask , how technically competent was this diagnosis ?
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death penalty .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
a few -- probably about as many creative people here .
it &apos;s renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
and that urgency , that goal , really changed my life .
the noises have the function of the letters of a script .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
so i think it &apos;s a very yellow hack .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
well , the living self lives continuously .
there was the core research facility of leopoldshaven .
pictures like this : a construction site along a much more troubled street .
well , the two types of self are actually tossing two concepts of happiness .
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest in researchers in happiness .
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
an eight-fold , mixed brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building existential , not intense .
i think , kind of , six dollars or something like that .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
finally , a solution big enough to solve our problems .
well , i wondered , how can i really get this over ?
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange landroad .
i grew up with a higher portion of science fiction .
i brought with me seven underpants , and that &apos;s all .
the composer is becoming more and more to the friend you live with .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
so a few years ago , i set out to do exactly that .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
so find programs that can sort of make up most likely numbers .
how can a judge turn someone into something that he &apos;s not ?
so , finally , here was a company that was trying to do it right .
is it as clear that the answer to the question is , you .
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the minerals .
and the interesting thing about this is , if i can take a little trip .
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they increase paralysis , and they lower happiness .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
and i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re really going to stay there .
i looked in the rail , and it was a little bit of pink .
right now it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and it &apos;s spread tirelessly , organic , of course .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism in our culture .
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
we find other oddities of what your rights are .
there was no piano yet as an instrument .
he said , &quot; bezos , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
it &apos;s about making goods flow out of scarce .
well , finally , the film has taken a very big momentum .
i think in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it out .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a ph.d. student .
it &apos;s our new home country called nunavut .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
by the end of march , the lhc will be operable again .
and when i listened to her , she made sooking noises .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
if we actually don &apos;t take up a phosphorus and give it away .
and just so all these companies disappeared one by the other .
if they could do it for those , they could help me , yes .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about that , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
you learn how to find the notes on the instrument .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
that &apos;s the time that most perceptions we have .
and somehow we have to create changes that go to zero .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
this is our youngest beta-test down there on the bottom right .
my friends in hduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
this is a fish rising in the southwestern corner of spain .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
what &apos;s the connection with the thoughts and feelings about them ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is my wlan-scale . very simple thing .
so this is just one application of many that you can do with it .
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
but nothing was invented that would let me go again so far .
that means you navigated about sound and about rhythm .
this actually includes just a two-and-a-half weeks period .
that &apos;s why the dramatic high numbers come to the prisoners .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
and then these are the formidable influences of pre-industrial culture .
some of my sounds happened in the last five years .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular pitch .
54 percent of the deaths have gone through drilling .
and then we worked out this kind of a code-free ct .
and the key indicator for this is the extinction of languages .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize on software for the winners .
and soon after that , i wrote an article on genetically modified food .
and i had to explain to the journalists that this test doesn &apos;t exist .
these people will be connected to the movie in eternity -- forever .
most people know this from the software field .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
and so i think the ted community should be bravers .
when someone lies , they &apos;re not just a liar .
do you know what you call a 3,00th major league baseball ?
and this is called androgenic defect .
even if you shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
we evolved to collaborate , heart creatures .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
and i was good , i graduated with cum laude .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
we live on a planet covering 70 percent of the water .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
this is naturally coming from asia , in the case of japan .
because a good engineer has either built a great car or a nuclear power plant .
and i tend to think of desires as my shadow .
but what if the image connected them to all of their images ?
often the music class is yes , you only learn the grades .
and then you can see the enormous speed possibilities there .
that is to lie so that you can just use this logic wrong .
just swap out the building of homes against cities .
&quot; do you remember the patients you sent home ? &quot;
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
the official faith sentence of all western industrialized societies .
bruno guissani : mark , come back .
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
so that was the very first start of a very own musical expression .
what you need is an environment that puts you in a position .
you collect information about the play in the secondary literature .
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how are we going to get there ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
there were quite a few studies conducted to see if that was true .
you can only have nullemissions if you &apos;re not there .
we should be able to rotate everything we want .
eight : tsunami warning . nine : cyberattacks .
now there &apos;s all this fame before the great unveiling .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be little bit bad .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
even if it doesn &apos;t seem to be appropriate , perhaps it &apos;s the most necessary thing to play .
the human being is supposed to come from the monkey or have a common ancestor .
according and quiet signs , f and b , etc .
on september 10 last year , the machine ran on the first time .
what were its circumstances , like society and politics ?
i like lots of black colors , lots of gray sounds and stuff like that .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inconvenient .
i love this one : &quot; watson impeers human opponents . &quot;
i played the first sentence by beethoven violin .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
specialized skills and processes and their combination lead to success .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded per minute .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights as a human being .
we &apos;ve distributed littlive to kids , and you see them playing with it .
this is all reality today , and in the future , much more will be possible .
people said , &quot; how come you &apos;re not afraid of never succeeding ?
i got in the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
but at the same time , we need a good proportion of intuition to actually execute the experiments .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make her very , very tired . &quot;
in my opinion , mass incarcerations have fundamentally changed our world .
so , interplay enables you to grow from ties , trust and coherence .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .

and this was an example of how our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than building them .
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually took .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten the forests of flour .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not a particularly grown meat .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to really devastating this world .
that will , i think , be part of the national statistic in the next decade or two .
if dan were a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes cabrio .
this can , in our case , be that we use it to design and create a symbol .
i spend most of my time with people in examinary , prisons or death cells .
and the color notes and the shades may remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to unleash us from this miserable situation .
you need this lie to get a lie of life to get a self-deception .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work on them .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone was dealing with it , there are two different things .
you &apos;ll never forget it because i &apos;m going to show you where the dalmatiner is .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that becomes a wetlands .
she &apos;s an up-front but ? are you something that brings blood into wallings ?
the categories have to say something to the selection , not to which the choice is done .
we want to preserve things that are gone or things that are no longer like they were .
so for example , the most sophisticated version of this kind of communication is human language .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the smartest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
add that buzzer to an additional effect , and they made a noise machine .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard of before will connect with global communication .
don &apos;t wait for one difference in another until they reach their first million .
the second largest group of people we can observe today are not motivated by money .
but before i get to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
because the phosphorus is devoted to the pigs about the solid ingredients of excrement .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of tibet if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom level .
now this may sound absurd to you , as far as you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
instead of pushing out the water , they used the canals to restore the water .
when you know something about government technology , you usually don &apos;t know it &apos;s not going on that way .
you hear a lot of talk about quantum mechanics saying everything is connected to everything .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailers fit with everything .
the day before the event , i called the head of public work for the company .
whether it &apos;s a place of mind or a bunch of acquisition , it &apos;s irrelevant .
and this is an idea that , when you think about it , can only meet you with hope .
and one reason is that this enormous heat rush is warming greenland from the north .
it was about a way of trying to figure out which parents are the right public schools for their children .
you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + one strength &quot; or &quot; + one intelligence . &quot;
that was our first attempt , starting with digital information , the genomic phi x 174 .
you have to make the sound of the wind , blow it away and read the rest of the book .
and as part of that , they made us a concept that was about anatomical similarities .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
just to give you an overview , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
we got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as we used to .
and the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in three generations who together build a new life .
players love to become part of the awe of the planetary scale .
i thought it would be like holding us our fancy clocks and dreaming cameras .
and the preparations for this were enormous . we had to build cameras and headlights and all kinds of things .
and i would like to just give to protocols that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is swing , but do you know what ?
i really hope that we play together important games to survive another century on this planet .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pitch of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly corrosive , but they &apos;re inherent .
one example of this from a very different area . monet painted the seaerose x-times .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
the next piece of the puzzle is how a boat is going on in the early morning in the red in lake .
you just can &apos;t emphasize enough of how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being &apos;s life .
by shaking the sidelines and putting them next to each other , he can let the characters interact ...
and by the way , the others are making androgens , which are viristic hormones .
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are master players .
or are we sure to be something else -- something that may actually be better adapted to the environment ?
in china today , a night of honeybean is still popping , you know , right ?
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice as to show this slide .
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
i was the second volunteer at the security station , so i had a pretty good opportunity to be able to do .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s phosphorus activity .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send her home , and there probably weren &apos;t a man in her treatment .
because obviously , an animal that was very common actually rarely gets before it dies .
for us , it &apos;s game fundamental for connection and tolerance .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle we all fight , so that &apos;s who can talk ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
one is the energy density these technologies generate dramatically lower than the power plants .
what would you do that you shoot up because you think you were there forever ?
we just wanted to know what was going on with a regular , iron electrical battery .
but the more i thought about it , the more i thought the fish knew something .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotated stuff , like maniook .
a tv or a washing machine , because they only use it , they don &apos;t use it .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than it is now that it is less .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not made up of teeth and claws alone .
i thought , &quot; make the camera out , &quot; that would mean that we wanted to have a conversation behind it .
but these articles made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i figured it out .
these are our master players . 500 million people , who are extraordinarily good at something .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
now you might think that the whole collapse of categories would really make someone happy like me .
this is the first object you can see that was in the quantum mechanical superposition .
in a sense , the arctic ice caps is the beating heart of our global climate system .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s only that architecture almost disappears .
our cities have been arranged , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
you might think this is just a landscape , and it &apos;s been manipulated by the lower part .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper almost every day , which is what you find in that third sentence .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishing cold and tentious to ourselves who can afford it .
i believe that somehow you &apos;ve moved to nostalgia to wonder .
when these imagery drops down , you can write on it , you can display patterns , images , text .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it &apos;s got a meaning and strength that it otherwise doesn &apos;t have .
if you put an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to get a pound of sugar tuna .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve changed the order to represent this information .
so , for example , the number 164 is very sticking out of this code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
bill big has several companies , including one called esolar , who has great solar thermal technologies .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
and i think the most important thing about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
we now have almost an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the mobile phone world .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
why not have the fast muscles that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
so maybe we sell a shoe , and it becomes the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
do the methods that are easy to use and begin to hug patients in the team .
i brought one example with you from the nootka-indians north american tribe .
once in high school , one student said that brian goldmann would learn for a blood test .
so when we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
maybe return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creativity .
we know that we work as human beings optimal , if we do hard , meaningful work .
well , we know from that study that you have to reach the needle when it comes to the thing .
we say , &quot; well , we &apos;ll generate a hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
this gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
and so from interested in this technology , i &apos;ve just gone on to this .
so we could take the world very easily with stupid ones , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
i &apos;m going to refer to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard of before .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the speed in one direction or the other .
and so by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since he , as i have to say , has been very successful introduction .
a third sentence that immediately comes up in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
and we may first know which wood we &apos;ve cut out of when we &apos;re really being tested .
this is called gestalt law or rocket psychology , which also affects us in perception .
so there are all the tools available , and the only thing that lifts us is our imagination .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , of ease , of contention .
so basically , what i &apos;m worried about is , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you make it possible .
and like a lot of people , i thought the government was mainly about choosing people into an office .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to embrace virtuality as a real habitat .
if someone asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be like ?
this question was so dazzling that we decided to explore the answer and develop sidelines .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re looking at next to being really stressed .
now , when i was a neuling in college , i had my first biology classes .
for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice screening package , which is liquid at room temperature .
the idea here , obviously , is not just overlists the machine operators in the control room .
we need to stop people from understanding things , especially when they &apos;re true .
in this country , we have children &apos;s life-long sentencing sentencing without a conditional punishment .
two : famine in somalia . three speakers : pfefferspray of police .
and she somehow managed to find time to soak up english and it-qualification .
now , reproduce all the remains that have best reproduced the numbers .
that i only do it differently and more beautiful doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better handable .
and that &apos;s half the world &apos;s underwater problems caused by the textile industry .
his mother was locked in being a punishment for -- for being wealthy for crime .
here &apos;s what it takes to recover what we understand under polite correctness .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so we can anticipate development .
this is almost limited to full security -- perhaps also to the fish , definitely for us .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really blew me out of the socks .
and this is how you see animals that are directly next to a 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
the other day they read her to go -- woman printer , woman , mother and grandmother .
one of the things about these archaic models is that we have a principle natural relationship with virtuality .
so , in the way that we move the evidence load you &apos;re seeing the magnificent of the lie .
for them , life had made a task : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we often feel different .
but i &apos;m not sure we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically the european .
michael j. nelson of the mystery science theater was a first person to make a joke on twitter .
as a child , i had collections of stickers , rocks , gies and claws .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska methane from even water .
both are strong understatements , because we don &apos;t really look at the problem as much as we should .
so in order for us to understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you an elementary , very simple magic trick .
also , despite their logarithmic course on the left , it &apos;s walking upward .
so , probably or evil aquaculture , fisheries , will be part of our future .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most commonly supported children &apos;s book .
this sounds very spacing , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
you either have a flute fusion or a paradise winds , and you &apos;ll have a choice .
i adored my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , oma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
so we have the memory itself and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that maybe our species has been around for 600,000 years .
unfortunately , this is all the good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got to face only two years later when we moved to california .
if i put myself in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
so , you need to have music language learning , at least as long as it is for spoken language .
we &apos;ve managed to get about a hundred genes out of the 500 or something that are here .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to court and do this crazy case .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
so we had to develop a new method where we could put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing its lifestyle .
and this really determines these ideas to deploy these limitations to the place that &apos;s available on the screen .
i got another gift , which is to look into the future and come back and live different .
the viral particles were then released from the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
and we &apos;re going to install an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microsecond .
so doing things like this -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor guy that seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
evolution is all about the next generation , adaptation and survival after generation .
if you surround with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it .
so in other words , the future has shrunk by a year since i &apos;ve been in the world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is exactly the opposite .
so we overlists our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t accept it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
so again , here we see this again again , again , this is all again , individual aggregate .
people are shaking themselves in their faith , so tightly you can &apos;t free them .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i would have spent another hour .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- except for my physiotherapy .
because people often come , they can &apos;t use it in a way that anybody can deal with it .
are we using these decisions to shape a society that &apos;s better , which is more successful , which is more friendly ?
most of the mass inmates in this country did not actually happen in the class of violence .
it &apos;s almost impossible physiologically impossible to be poor if you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have a few downsides .
well , you can see , in all cases , no one has to be a viewing candidate .
police officers came in and dedicated state lawyers and offices .
this reference will propose that we will invest money in more security forces and security .
this is sort of the deadline that has shown us the environmental models that we need to be holding .
unfortunately they don &apos;t in openbach , but maybe they can help the fryer a little bit .
you don &apos;t sit around and you spin . there &apos;s always something important to do .
when i went back there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half its size .
i &apos;m assure they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
do you say that there are negative effects that are dealing with the clouds that are shifting things ?
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the human ancestry .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come in , and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
and that sadness really evolved in a thought , which is that i wish only one thing .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
so to me , photography seemed more like going to the right place at the right time .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often called a &quot; passenger wave reactor . &quot;
and also , a recent study was done by ceos , where they watched the ceos for a week .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
they care about the creators , they usually have the first semester , the great rock laws .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time in choosing our collective good .
now , morgan , on behalf of transparency , this is what happened right now with the $ 7100 ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow people liked that .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your drive ?
because first in this context , we &apos;re beginning to understand the truly amazing things that we are looking at .
this also represents the entertainment value of this talk , so i hope you enjoy it .
nothing moves into my sleeve or comes out , no trickiness . and you can study everything .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics , who made me crazy , were not fanatics at all .
well , just to conclude , i want to realize that i talked a lot about the fathers .
but there &apos;s no bias we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
his cause to write the play will become more and more of my personal cause to play it .
it turns out it actually meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your movie . &quot;
we had a team of fellows in boston last year in the suit of the code for america program .
at the moment , it was as if a film director had demanded a shift in the film .
this is the way , if i said , shake your child , it only strikes it three times rather than five .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first fuel of the fourth generation , which in about 18 months .
and the main lesson that i think we have learned is that they &apos;re really different .
but these concepts of cyberage , and they bring us back to rediscover these possibilities .
so these tendencies to survive longer , and they multiplied at greater extent .
i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that they were just going to shrink this model .
the first example predicts what many of you know and some of you don &apos;t need very few of you at all .
so the neurons are the information processing system that these cell communities have built .
so , we were able to relate the little digital warheads to the rotor control .
so , imagine you were in a number of places at the same time , how would that feel ?
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using a lot recently is evolution itself .
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus ; it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
when professors get curious , they get often put in the n research mester .
echinacea , a little antioxidantic that helps you on the leaps .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with your own fake .
and it &apos;s about solving a problem in a playful , creative , original way .
so what happens is the machine age , and what happens is the book , and what happens is the photolitography is .
and that &apos;s just how words come out , which we use over and over again in the language of the political correct speech .
for example , in the open-house garbage , 20 percent of the garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage is now wining .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them , we could do a , or we could make b .
but then over and over again , very rarely , something special happened , and one of the performers actually became overwhelming .
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but here &apos;s the thing : if you get evidence , you have to adopt this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
so i &apos;m now in front of one of my favorite images , tar breugel harvest workers .
i want to explain something to you today , or bring something to this mechanism , something that you &apos;re unaware of .
my heart raced , i was dizzy while i was trying to grasp what was in front of me .
when we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
immediately , they will experience one for which , of course , there are these forecasts , which you can &apos;t prove .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from a few of them ?
the greeks called these divinous divinity spirits of creativity , moonies .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it go into the next century .
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; we &apos;re running out of oil . &quot;
who knows when the movie comes out , maybe we look like a horror vollididate .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have threatened before only one generation , barely yet .
because if we could find out that , we would rather have never been able to provide any human potential before .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to be able to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then increase my strength and longevity .
if you break down the gold glass so everything is possible , you lower happiness .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of a mixture of scrabble and boggled .
they make the decision -- they make up , even when it comes to their own best interests .
so , regardless : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , so i can zoom back out , zoom in .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of the numbers .
now , sounds very banal first , but it &apos;s so exciting to think about it in a way that &apos;s going to be more busy .
and in order to win , the device has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
it would have been without the environmental requirement , but it makes it so much more important .
we hope that that &apos;s no longer pop-ups and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self , at the end you &apos;re going to do very different things .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a tape recorder .
man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the hurricane .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;m going to tell you a few interesting things that happened since the launch .
as peter told us , not only do they produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
certainly , i would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
they played a cube , and the siders were allowed to break into an epic adventure .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on the planet .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success of the scientific method .
the founding fathers , from my point of view , were the original anatomical activists , and that &apos;s why .
there &apos;s actually a corner , by the way , which i won &apos;t tell you about , where the wirelesslan works .
the human part of that bay , far at the end , is , of course , the most interested in it .
and of course in holland , you understand this easier , because in holland , you know , the country is built on flowers .
they found an article that was wrong with thought , and they could find the creator of that thought .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a shared language , a basic preservation , to build the right prototype .
perhaps that &apos;s exactly the sense of efficacy , a sense of iority , a sense of our own power .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new level of existence .
well , i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , oma . i promise it . &quot;
if we can do that , then this current data trap will become , maybe a new source of meaningful information .
i know we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now .
today we want to talk about how videos become viral , and then finally , why this is important at all .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
this is really important , because this is an insight that is not in a single wiki pediasi .
i tried to make it clear how valuable cities are to how much more valuable they are than they are .
they live in a world that has abundance information and communication , as nobody could have predicted .
so people who think evolution is going to change as a gene at a time , have missed a lot from biology .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve stopped with what &apos;s called the gigapixel technology .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six that have stable structures .
our language then connotes the social changes that have been caused in many cases by a technological change .
icebergs are born as a calf of a glacier , or by breaking out of ice sheets .
and i noticed how much these deep sea events looked like a space mission .
so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
we made small pieces , we made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
that was the movement . it was the justification . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
but i regret to be , but i &apos;m best possible to learn from that to pass on .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken in by the mind . how can you be hurt ?
the more possibilities they have available , the more they put all their money into pure money-market converts .
there are very , very few things you can even say , there &apos;s an opportunity in a million of them .
but danny , throughout american pursuit , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
and even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard because it pushes people together very quickly .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little bit of an explanation of what you &apos;re about to see .
no one ever makes a mistake , but nobody is concerned about the details of how to do this .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have determined what the goal is .
and you &apos;re going to offer them all the nutrients that they could only want without any effort on their part .
it &apos;s about how happy or enjoying that person is when that person is thinking about their lives .
so that , as citizens , you are able to put yourself in a position to deal with these scientific technologies .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to get a realistic result .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
i don &apos;t want this thing to break down into 20 parts of the way it &apos;s known from documentaries .
i spent a lot of my life trying to be myself and adapt to me at the same time .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you dropped it somewhere .
because the floor is going to die , and the wind is going to wash away , and the water is going to wash away .
you can go out and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can put your own collection on your own .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they really produce droughts .
there are as controversial things as these whole genetically modified plants on the drivers .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of , how far can you take a piece of the future out there ?
so the idea is that we &apos;re actually involving people where they &apos;re doing things together , collectively .

today , you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a price of about 20,000 dollars and into the space of about a week .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; what care ? let &apos;s do what they want .

they didn &apos;t matter because he had remained with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had received to keep it .
i think molecular biology in general now , which is , generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count on , synthetic biology and so on .
i came to ted because i think a lot of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is going a long way out , but it &apos;s increasing justice .
one process that -- as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- in other words , everybody here -- doesn &apos;t always feel reasonable .
and something interesting happened here , because what fascinated me about jacques cousteout &apos;s shows was the idea of a completely unknown world on our earth itself .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it into sound , we turn it into sound , we create something very complicated in the heads of others .
it &apos;s a very happy concert over and over again , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve worked in the previous few years as to reexperience .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we are not just consumers , and we are not just consumers of government paying and receiving taxes .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as though the first sentence of earlier was wrong , as though , of course , you must take the opposite with no evidence .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive grocery store , at least at the time he was really exclusive .
in a country that has just been elected a huge crisis in congress for this change in congress , at 124 , was elected to a voice .
it seems that we are quite remote from the other parts of life , but in fact most of life &apos;s construction , the fundamental mechanisms are pretty much the same .
well , there are brands and eightful brands , these things that come and go , but a blessed , eight brands is a pretty strong thing .
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do this , and we came back and all the images on the walls would be very dumb .
yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , building the coal plant because we don &apos;t have any else , or gastorm , because it &apos;s not possible .
according to burrelle , the premier was in january , and since then -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls from this film .
but this is keeping me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as badly as we do now , never before .
in fact , we start from a new point : we digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new life .
so , what these reactors was a problem , what we put in our fills , and therefore the volume of waste is dramatically reduced during this process .
well , in egypt , the insurgency of the egyptians in april 2011 plundered the headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of acts .
but if you &apos;ve got very cheap fuel , you can fill it in for 60 years -- think of a column -- think of a pillar -- that buried it , without all the complexity .

we &apos;re going to have a process that usually requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even to the next 100 years .
personally , i find it easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
in nine people we executed , one of them that we found was innocent , which was discharged and discharged from the death cell .

one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; thylacine in my trash tone . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
this plane is made up of hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make their flight safer . &apos; don &apos;t you mind ? &quot;
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on the planet ; i &apos;m talking about creating a life of possibilities .
so for example , an organism could learn not to eat a particular fruit because it was bad and it was sick the last time it eaten it .

there are a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are fresh bwl graduates .
a juice pender , if you make the full of water , has enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s something like 40 to six thousand or so bar .
the reason that i was worse , with all these possibilities available , i had my expectations for what a few good jeans were going up .
it &apos;s about how to encounter people in interactive media , so that they can use these interactive media , so that they can create an enabling experience .
and a lot of the discussions i &apos;ve had over the last six years have been kind of like the discussion i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years on photovoltaics .

so that &apos;s when i was back with a small team on unknown terrain , and we turned &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that had not existed before .
and then we don &apos;t have that , but that &apos;s just , i think , quite well underway , people are pretty well convinced of this .
we want the world of creators , of inventors , of encouragement , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .

i mean , it can sound odd to think that one thing at the same time is in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea ; they developed it .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but as we go up into the time machine , and we &apos;re going to be happy to have that done .
so one day i decided to visit the filium jet , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work to offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;

maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was doing this , and so i would be able to take care of my patients without having to contact them .
and since there was no video games or this disclosure with computer-generated movies or all the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
and so i think of myself as one of the people , along with most other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good fraction of logic to bring together the complex ideas .
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the overload so we could sequence them , because we &apos;re trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never could have imagined before .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of speech , &quot; a kind of solution .
and imagine if i &apos;ve been negotiating as a five-year-old child with dr. p. , and so try to stop these practices , naturally without success .
bg : well we need one of these scalable , generating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .

90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the healing bump , the salmon , heavy fish , they have collapsed .
we can take a step further out , and then rearrange the data , and see that circuit disease and cancer are the common suspects , but not for everybody .
unlike the one-way conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new out of it .
my wife , my kids and i have moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and archists have taken over our house .
bg : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than that that has tripled to inflation of average income in the world .
i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it became a love movie of epic scales , a passionate movie .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of map the electrical proportions of the island one to three exactly .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classical softer , you need five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , you only take one hour .
i &apos;m a wall animal . to work , i have to stand up and sweat at at at the same time every day , abandon and really awkward through .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the cube , and they put together a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
so far , these insulanders , they &apos;re always trying to do autark , they have their own little web , and it &apos;s got nothing to do with our connection .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions of technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed world , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest of it .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected connections that we form are the real food ground of creativity .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play together some kind of game to control their health better .
that means that the interpret has to translate these miserable missions of the emergency language into another , namely hearing , concrete , non-verbal music language .
and not only has apple been an intuitive economic factor only since i &apos;m trying to harness human technology devices .
a lot of journalists called me with the question , &quot; what test are you going to do that tells us whether caster semenya is female or male ? &quot;
now , what i hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields of one thing that &apos;s wrong .
just as you knew in the village then , who has something about who and when , this is what &apos;s happening now over this expansion of our own devices on a global scale .
if i tell you that somebody ordered your life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of insecurity about how happy he is with his living self .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan it , to find the different places for the puzzle .
well , i was doing telephone with a few people in the company , and nobody could give me a decent answer , and until finally i was doing telephone with the length biologists .
we got to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an e-mail that said nathaniel was interested in school in me .
and the reason is that it used to be better than anything worse than it was when everything worse , it was possible for people to experience who were a pleasant surprise .

how would it feel to live in a world where german state made people , especially if disproportionately under that were many jews .
and very often i &apos;ve been working with intersexual people whose gender is atypical -- so people who don &apos;t show the average male or female body types .
and if you &apos;ve already gotten along that the droplet of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science itself .
we all had to do that at the time . when we read a book as kids , we took the description of the author and we projected it on the canvas in our heads .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be creating a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there may be massive new species of artification based on this digital design .
and there &apos;s a lot of trouble at the media campus , for example , that we &apos;re doing virtual reality in our v.r. lab , and we can actually do that all the time .
and i tried to negotiate with me that if i double my efforts to perfection , i never again made a mistake that the voice could get worse .
but it turns out also , because it turns out , by using play all this time , we &apos;re actually changing what we can do as human beings .
i can today bring the noises that the stream has had to sound on the modern wing , which a barockes cembalo can &apos;t do .
even from the german to the english language , you can ask more knowledge , including when you &apos;re talking about poetry or even about poetry .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the strongest psychoactive preparat from the repertoire of the shaman .

they &apos;re staring out at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is curved canals and these dense , lousy march .
at this point , and if you laugh , you can see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can share very well with us .
one of the areas in which we see this in our culture today in the united states today is the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .

and what &apos;s happened is , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , on climate .
we now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
let &apos;s go back to my medical world , where i feel a lot better or maybe a little less good after i talked to you about it .
basically , you get every round on every sible letter that you happen to get , and as you try to make words , they get tested by a dictionary .
and because the government ultimately exhausts its power -- he remembers , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , will affect how this change happens .

so now it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever committed -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
if you &apos;re playing also , you can see some nuances here zoomed up , and your mouth is a sign of optimism . your eyebrows are surprising .
a lot of arguments against it . fish pollution the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
if this device sequences a rna-or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls the health authorities and prevents a pandemic before the outbreak .
now , i &apos;m going to ask all of these instructions to happen to lead out all of the programs , and finally pick the ones that i want to be the closest . &quot;
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the beaches in venice , my children were brought in , my dog was brought in , and we created this .
but i think , in this framework here , and with the intention of doing something real from a deception , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go off the stage .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
now , when you do the math , people bought a glass of march six times more than when they had 24 choices .
these are two very different units , the living self and the remembering self , and these two are part of the interference of happiness differently .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we have put into the cell .
and because they work much harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they disagree in their weight , in energy consumption , a little 30-billion people .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , at a point when there was a break , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
and from my point of view , the scientific method of trying things out is to see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements in humanity .
so , from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and only from that degradation to yes , to the idea that a hundred percent renewable yes .
i think that the remarkable of the events that have been happening over the last decade , is that we &apos;ve moved from a physical world to a digital world .
so that i started sending her home , i missed a slight voice inside of me , trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
so gender is really complicated ; intersexual is not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be spread all the bandwidth .

this is a people who are not cognitively different from the colors of blue and green , because the celestial scene is the equivalent of the forest that people depend on .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and explored the deep sea .
we &apos;re seeing many , many gigabytes of digital photographs here , which you can rearrange seamlessly and continuously , in any way .
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which all of you recognize at a very long distance in the forest that seems to our eyes as a kind of a species .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole idea that the idea of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , let it see as many people as possible .
so if you take the system the way i was taught , and you extract all the miserable health professionals , then at the end there &apos;s no one left .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , a director has to lead , a leader has to be like a ship captain or something .
now , our system has a pricing increase , because we &apos;re not going to do it for even 20 percent with this el and also an award increase on all the other things .
we only have for two years of phosphorus , and already , through phosphorus mining in the world , much more uranium is being used in all the nuclear facilities .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to build the right systems .
we predict that in 10 years , the reference rate of civil honoring rights will be as high as before the passage of voting legislation .

i recently made a poll with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that a typical american american woman makes on a day is 70 .
they &apos;re also in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , also electronics tinkering , and combined that in a pretty remote way .
now , that &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and people should just stop worrying .
and then we screwed up a d.v.d brenner and took the laser out , and then tried to focus on this camera .
you should discuss this strategy of innovation , and you &apos;d be shocked by the ridiculously low money spent on these innovative approaches .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off that el .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instructions is very small that by chance they &apos;re using numbers , so none of the instructions are actually going to do this .
that is , instead of remembering us individually , we have standardized , widespread , in vast , common patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories on .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than i am today , and therefore i will have on my palette of music sounds even more color chances , emotions and emotions than i am today .
and yet , burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkably clean coal technology that you see here changes everything .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady tuckers of the engine , clapping any wave on the bug , the long and empty horizon .
now , if we go on and sort of at age , let &apos;s say 40 years or more , we see that accidents are actually the main thing about which people should worry about .
and by the way , we migrate and circate and mix us so much that you can &apos;t tell that isolation is necessary for evolution to find statement .
it was exposed in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material took it , so we ended up with only one cell at the end with a new chromosome .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and i should do that too , because that love story , as romantic as it is , is also inconclusive .
everybody thinks i &apos;d run away between titanic and &quot; avatar &quot; and had been celebrating the nails on a towel on a beach somewhere .
and these scientists have simply documented the different topics that these ceo has been doing , and how much time they spend making decisions related to the issues .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
it looks something like this , who has no freedom , can &apos;t be drawn to responsibility for his actions and claims , and therefore he &apos;s unacceptable .
it &apos;s the living self that attacks the physician -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; is it now hurt if i file you here ? &quot;

what do you believe like the average achievement of a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedic , a birthday worker , should be a rescue assistant ?
and they do some tests , and they find out that instead of having iron sticks and uterus , she actually has testicles inside her and she has a y chromosome .
now , with all of our digital devices that we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day , to put all these negative news messages , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
and we start by taking the garbage that already exists in these refrigerators or dry containers in the reactors . that &apos;s our start fuel .
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe it or not , from these adventures have learned nothing new .
the riders for intractable objects are not just humans , but also the light that appears to you and the wind that is passing past you and the heat of space .
but tomorrow , tomorrow , it can change from the digital world to the challenge -- think about climate change , think about co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
no longer a building that would open up to let you have a building , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without becoming wet .
and when you play with your particles , you find all sorts of weird things -- like you fly right through walls , or that at the same time you can be in two different places .
and what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like so few others , that we often meet in our field , is a kind of semi-logarithmic curve right now .
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic health projects are missing : because we stopped listening .
and most of all , are we ever going to be able to develop the wisdom and master the wisdom we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
well , in our city where volunteers supported a highly qualified professional fire department , you must be at the edge of the brand pretty early to be able to interfere .
but it takes a lot of the time until she gets to puberty and her breasts grow and develop , but she doesn &apos;t get her period until someone comes to the fact that there &apos;s something different here .
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that history was trying to crush us , but we were overcoming it .
it demands that we all focus our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimal , like our emotions and our do , in the challenge that lies in front of us .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , which , when you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
i would rewrite it like this : not the strongest of his species , but the most intelligent of his species , but the one that can adapt to change the best .
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met were the sahari from the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern columbia , the most extraordinary .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximize our citizen well-being , most importantly , this goes through maximizing of the freedom of the individual .
in fact , the droplet , which had one for growth had more optimal composition faster than others , and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and divided faster .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 pounds of per hectare , 30-ton tons per hectare , or at the square meter .

the model is already leaped in the womb and it &apos;s intercultural , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , without most of us knowing that this model is there .
and what we &apos;ve done since , since two thousand-nine , the hall has finished , until today , basically , about everything that was here between the single system of electronics to develop software , we &apos;ve done .
there are all of these things in life of viencies and challenges , and they &apos;re just too real , and each person is dealing with it differently , but the question is not whether we deal with viencies or not , but how we deal with it .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by old style evolution to neo-evolution .
we shouldn &apos;t deny or deny these challenging times , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor should we go underneath the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing in the vienity of opportunities .
imagine if you could have little helicopters flying through the air , and each of you with a little bit of a change image -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
if we manage to encourage the human spirit to continue to hope , to find ourselves and other people around them , to be curious and fantasy , then we really put our forces in a positive way .
and when i listened to her chest with the stethoscope , i could hear a cracking sound on both sides , which told me that she suffered from concrete heart failure .
and through this kind of transmission , much like the metaphor of the desktop , but now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a action pattern , of a action leap .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been looking at this , which means , actually , what &apos;s still natural for us , what &apos;s also , perhaps , unlearned , but also instinctive , so what &apos;s the difference ?
but if we can do it that an effective windows-virus encounters on a laptop that &apos;s used by a waiting engineer to configure this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was contacted in 1958 peaceful .
after these expeditions , we really started to learn what we saw down there , like these deep debris , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and these are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they use tools like the state strojaner to crack their computers with a trojan who allows them to monitor their entire communication , listen to their online discussions , to collect their passwords .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could limit it to , but in the big and big , that &apos;s something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to have to take the complicated view of what &apos;s in well-being .
last month , with a study that shows that by the end of this decade , solar energy in the sunny areas of the u.s. will be six cents a kwh compared to 15 cents a national average .
and this may surprise something because my full-time job at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds to the things we invent and have to deliver to the poorest 2 billion lives .
i &apos;m grateful to the premium columa person that he rehabilitated the word again because after the fall you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left was bad .
we challenge teams all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone to talk to the machine because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test inside or your blood value .
some of us may have chosen one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high aptitute , which is at the same time in both hemisphere .
one is seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision that from noah snakes , a university student in washington , under the counseling of steve silk on uw .
okay ? there we were , fighting through the wetlands , and i heruge and sweat , have matsch up to my knees , and miguel is holding a biology lecture .
and we know right now it just doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look into the future 30 or 50 years , because everything will be so different that a simple high-speed computation of what we &apos;re doing right now doesn &apos;t make sense .
play industry is developing consolations that can save energy and work on mobile devices instead of broadband internet so that players around the world , especially in india , in china , can play online .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastria and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and in the next few weeks also your micro-cell phone , to find the next aed that can save lives .
you get to big sums of money , and here you can disagree with reasonable people if you have something that &apos;s not economic and try to finance that . for me , this is where most waste happens .
so first of all , when you enter one of these online games , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters willing to trust them a world-class mission , right now .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is that steve levitt told you yesterday about how this teurer and hard to install car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
and then i realized , when he says a farm that has no prices , it underruns enormous , because the water that flows through this farm comes in from the river of guadalquivir .
especially in today &apos;s world , at this intersection of new and old media and the fragmented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting negotiation tool that the mask is bringing this message .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we all need to do together , together , are we going to be just a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
this is a state in which your heart fails instead of pumping the entire blood further , a part of your blood will stick in your lung and fill it all together , so the shortcut came .
but actually , this note for the things we do that don &apos;t completely lead to the big reductions is just the same , or even a little less important , like the others , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
so i gave another talk with facts that involved one graph like this , which tries to illustrate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
and i left medical school with the impression that if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as possible , that i was immune to making mistakes .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking at biohacking for a few years now , and this is what i started doing , because i just wanted to know more about it , and i wanted to do it for myself , most of all , what i learned in this way in college , theoretically .
because in the moment i turn my hand away from you , so you can see it from behind , this finger moves here , my time finger , just from where it was , to a position where it &apos;s stretched out like this .
not even to burn the seed a little bit better and defend it and lose all the materials for cycles in the burn plant , but first to ask , how do you close cycles ?
that is , i &apos;ve actually shifted them to the point where they don &apos;t realize any pattern in it anymore , but i &apos;ve been putting them in the picture within a very short time , to see this dog again and again in this pressed image .
in other services , like making fertilizers , 105 : 05 : 56,000 -- &amp; amp ; 00 : 58,000 or air transport or air transport , the playground is much smaller .
and if i then take another step further into these natural user interfaces , where , by voice , by touch , by touch , by gesture , by touch , by gesture , by mouse and cursor , things need to be controlling , i &apos;m even faster and more immediate .
they empowered us to tell the story of neuromarketing , just as we tell the story in this movie , that today you &apos;re using mris to mimic the brainstorms of the brain to make both commercials and films .
now if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government officials , some of them come from science , some of them , some of them , even less , come from economics . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the music field .
we need solutions , either one or more , that have an unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability , and even though there are lots of directions in which people are looking for it , i really see only five that can afford these big demands .
when you live in california , there &apos;s a census decision in this spring that &apos;s actually about doing a job of implementing something of the money stream that otherwise flows into the policy of punishment .
that is , you &apos;ve found yourself so that you &apos;ve spoken a shared language , you could communicate with each other , you &apos;ve moved to the same cave , you &apos;ve moved to other areas , you &apos;ve created cities or villages , and you &apos;ve sort of created tribal society .
most women , like i do -- i believe being a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosome structure , but i think i probably have the typical one -- most women like me actually respond to androgens .
if you allow someone to activate their own internal forces -- the human mind is so reception -- if they can do that , and for someone at a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their brand personality disconnect two , but it &apos;s an inspiring side -- the morgan spurlock-brand is an eight-hour brand .
and dr. kean kept telling me , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that if you don &apos;t get something else all the time , and even if you just get a little bit of support if you leave kids on their own , kids can achieve a lot . &quot;
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and wrote this information with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
something interesting happened at &quot; abyss : to solve a narrative problem in this movie -- and that is that we had to create some kind of liquid water -- we were taking back on computer-generated animation , cg , cg .
when we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s going to exceed all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we turned to different mechanisms .
and so i get a very different view from the city , a very different sense , which is that i see negative and positive zones of a city , and so in this way , a very different virtual map from a very real city .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a retailer , a retailer , in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boots .
let me introduce you to elegs that are carried by amanda boxtel , who had spinal cord injury 19 years ago , which has come to the conclusion that she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years and so far .
as i said before , over the years , i &apos;ve been putting myself in some pretty horrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could get me prepared for anything as difficult and as dangerous as these guys in a room .
and i want to say something that a feminist is a little bit radical , and that is that i think there might be different kinds of insights that govern from different kinds of anatomy , especially when people apply group thinking .
for example , take this child of barasana in the northwest of the amazonas , the people of the anakonda , believe that they came up with the milky flow of the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
we turned off the light , put it in a vacuum , and we sucked out all the air , and we cooled it up until almost now , just in the elevator , the piece of metal was free to behave as it wanted .
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that wrap the earth around and is as important to the earth as the biological food web you know as a biosphere .
but because this didn &apos;t happen here , we can digitize it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and preach messages of fear and illiteracy tism of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
cohler evolution pushed the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in electricity , and therefore we have refrigerators , climate conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
we see this here , when i design things , then i can confuse them like on the right-hand side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salty and pepper , or i can sort of make them intuitively by showing things .
but that &apos;s the nicest thing that can happen , because this is group compulsion , group compulsion , to help patients , because this could be used against obesity , or it could be able to get patients to smoke .
what it turns out is that if you &apos;re offering a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aspirintablet , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
business that is not worlds for itself is operating businesses that are restoring instead of replacing utilities that are growing existentially , instead of just intense , farmers that are not only producers , but experts in relationships .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , one of my students asked me , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , they still do it -- a really curious question .
and my nose was always in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts to other worlds , and in a narrative way , my deep sitting in me , peaceful curiosity .
here &apos;s an experience of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually just using heft-mechanisms with the right design of the piece , we &apos;ve adjusted them . yeast then automatically assembles them .
and in the same kind of a rice stage , nathaniel , when we first started teaching in the walt disney hall , he had lost that misery in his eyes and worked completely .
there was some lawyer or consumer stewards who now could tell for the rest of his life that he went to a burning house to save a living creature , just because he was five seconds faster than me .
the other hat that i &apos;ve been wearing in my work is the activist , as a patient lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
i want to say that i probably know a few bright laborers of labs , who are more collaborative , more intelligent and richer decisions about making their sexual relationships than some 40-year-olds i know .
a few years ago , i went to a food market in this red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a shelf of tomatomatoes .
so these are the three main flu groups : criminals who do it for money , hacktivsts like anonymous who do it , but the last group are nations , governments , who lead the attacks .
and in this folder , there were notes from a local company in germany that the egyptian government had sold a few programs that they were able to take -- in very large scales -- any communication of egyptian citizens could dismiss .
if you &apos;re feeling lousy -- if you fall easily in power -- i &apos;ve introduced this to some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman nearly got powerful .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be adopted , because they &apos;re , of course , through a human gut , they &apos;re called monoamin-oxidase .
and when these tools become more physical and develop awareness for their movements , recognize each other and feel the enemies of our walking around with them , then we can begin to explore new and entertaining ways of interactions .
where i had seen the most exciting recently was the south african runner caster semenya last year , whose gender was questioned at the body chatlethik world cup in berlin .
the question is , quite simply , if you are totally independent of any fossil or ancient energy that are being drifted out anywhere in the world , you are an island .
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to search for work -- sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clothing .
what could be more lonely than being surrounded by the silence , be one of the last to your people who speak your language , not having no possibility of passing on the wisdom of the ancestors , or expecting the hope of children ?
many old-fashioned societies , including the greeks and the romans , really believed that the language of a flight has a great force , because what you &apos;re talking about loud can manifest itself .
then it goes forward because that doesn &apos;t trust the front , and says , well , look again , and sure if what you see is also what you want to see .
but as the already quoted examples of the synonymous dictionaries prove , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we &apos;d all wish : to allow each individual to be a powerful person .
they threw shiny photos out of the air , which we consider as friendly gestures , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen anything two-dimensional .
they left lydics and they went looking for a new home , and they just left back as many people as there was food to survive and searched with the rest of an area where they could thrive .
in one case , you might have someone with an xy chromosomes base , and the sry gene at y chomosoms is throwing the protogonads that we all have to grow up in high .
you may actually have saved your people through play by letting them fly into games for 18 years , and then have this introduction and learn so much about playing with each other , so that by saving all of civilization .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and essig and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drank relief water .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms will shrink the exploration of happiness , and i am one of the many researchers of well-being who have raped the exploration of happiness in that same way .
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma ghotalium , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to see if we can do it with a smaller genome .
let &apos;s take a look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person of today in a country with strong game culture , with 10,000 hours of online play to the 21st year .
bg : right . now you always have to refill the reactor , so there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and bring things in -- it &apos;s not good !
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where either one of 10 medications is either a false or wrong thing where hospital infections are always getting more and more and more payment and more devastating or making dead .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the rift between the long and the short-term thinking people will be terrible between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich rural and almost all life of those two billion will be much worse .
this is a problem because warming is freezing the frozen reason for the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon , which , when it &apos;s recording , when it &apos;s imposing microbes to methane .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s going on in evolution , and how we think about the place of human beings in evolution , and most importantly , we look forward into the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
so maybe this technological change is very clear because any one of us has always had a different truth , which is that every human being in society can give something special and very powerful and that the human ability to adapt is our biggest plus .
and what we also found is that the goal of attacking was actually to let it happen slowly and unfortunately -- obviously to try to have warning engineers despair , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to quickly get behind it .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of memory , and you can think of the memory of self as one that kind of drags the living self through experiences that the heritage itself doesn &apos;t need .
now the amazing thing is that the betakarboline contained in liane are mao-inhibitors of exactly the kind that are necessary to enable the tryptamins . so ask yourself .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we &apos;ve sort of become aware of ourselves , o.k , it &apos;s now giving us as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are always chatting there and so forth .
but , as we think , the only way that biology will have a huge impact without any extra increases in the cost of food or restriction of its availability is when we see co2 as a source material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
i started working through academic literature about how these centrifuges are built in natung , and found that they &apos;re structured in what &apos;s called cascades , and each cascade contains 164 centrifuge .
so there are big prizes here . there are challenges for transmission . if we say , for example , the energy source outside the country is not only the technology , you need to deal with the risk that the energy coming from where else is .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw it with a laser pointer on it , only registering the negative area .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to take a strike and use less , but on average , that number will rise every year and double , so the number of services that will be provided by each person .
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people go up , and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to insult them , or frankly , they go away .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that becomes the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is going to make great jumps , doubt the price performance quotist every 12 to 24 months .
it &apos;s inside -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code consists of regular letters that we &apos;re using for symbolizing -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve amplified it 10 .22 times .
they then , over a three-month period of time , students with a &quot; enough &quot; note &quot; very well , and they were told that they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote in .
and i wonder today how much of my vision as a strong and powerful girl shaped my self-image , and i could imagine looking at myself as one of nature as one of strong , powerful and atrothic human beings .
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the atmosphere of ever-cell , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom is completely covered with brands -- from the cover sponsor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the brand x .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re called from my general physician , so he can see where my weight problem is , not only in the moment i need kardiological support or something , but also in the past .
it &apos;s an image of the first radiation particle that took all the way back to the lhc , then , in advertently , colonized with a part of the lhc to put a rain of particles on the detector .
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on its head so that instead of always going from one to the other , we could begin to go from a lot of things to many things , by seeing patterns which otherwise would have remained hidden ?
and the message is , we need to get on these rotating masses , if we like , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 percent , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we even want to reach them .
he killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beetles , bone and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can break the course of aids .
that was worth closing me in the clean room for all this year , because , you check that , the massroots difference between one individual atom and that piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
when a performer in spain did something impossible , something magical : it &apos;s my -- it &apos;s my allah , ol√© , ol√© , allah , great , bravo &apos;s incredible , it &apos;s been here : a glimpse of god .
and then i spent it all the way through six and a half , and then we &apos;ve become co-founded with friends of the company , solon , which then became one of the largest cell manufacturers in the world with spin-off q-making .
at the time , it was just as a monkey where adel , klerus and others said , you &apos;re actually insane when people start reading , then afterwards they want to talk to each other , and of course that &apos;s completely fatal .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found , something very fundamental : in most of the life &apos;s existence in solid organisms , each cell divides , and all the genetic information of the cell is continued in both of the toweries .
that is , we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there is no bio-farm , no bioland , no granted progression , and how they all name , that allow our own excreations to go back .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents you would never walk , and never be as moving as other kids or that you could never live an independent life , and since then they just punished me . &quot;
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 80s when i just started elementary school , and started to build and shape my self-image outside my family &apos;s field , even in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and because i was born without washing legs , and my feet had been set up after them , and i only had a few toes on that , and a few toes on the other foot , he was the overdder , this stranger had to bring the bad news .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so attractive , at the end , we &apos;re not at the end of our technology , not at the things we &apos;re developing , not at our intellect and minds .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i came here to say to this young man , don &apos;t lose the target . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
and i definitely know that it would be -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start to sort of downlocking that dark path of suspect -- especially in the circumstance in which i &apos;m in my career right now .
the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencer for live design that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the culmination as sound , such as leadership , bass and drudgery .
immediately after this election between the 21st and february 24th , a delegation of about 30 famans went to the two places in the world that were most interested in getting into the city hall business .
it would be worse , though , if i didn &apos;t remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer , i was faced with the same kind of anxious response .
and it &apos;s very amazing because it &apos;s actually believed that this wedding technology that you &apos;re encountering is actually bringing you into the future , but in fact , the future is right with us , in our archaic roots .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which had shrunk for close to three million years the size of the lower 48 states , by 40 percent .
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand on the edge of an epic victory at any given time that we prefer to spend all of our time in these games .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men are either in prison , in prison , in currency , or with conditions of punishment .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that contain the five-to-seven-to-seventh letters , putting them together to make 24,000-letter pieces to repair them , up to 72,000 .
later on the day i was driving around with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
so , imagination is more than form , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to also like to close to giving a and again the clue , designers also have to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in that sense thank you very much for your attention and your request .
i &apos;ve always accomplished my synonymous dictionary in writing , but i &apos;ve been done with the process of writing , and i realized that i &apos;ve never looked into my life , which means that the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the figure , found nothing and concluded that this was the business cards of the devil , and killed the five missionary with the spear .
and if i take another halboval , suddenly we don &apos;t just see another unit , which is circle , circle , circle , and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three parts anymore , one circle , another circle .
and that &apos;s just one of these little devices that i hold up , because things are supposed to get more intuitive , more natural , more and more user , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually natural for us humans , what &apos;s user-friendly or intuitive .
are you not afraid that you &apos;re going to follow your life in this craftswork and never make anything happen , and you &apos;re going to die on a crumpled dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
if we &apos;re in a world of play , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , at any given time and instantly willing to try and solve the problem , as long as we need , try it again after the failure .
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the baffin islands , when i went to the narwhal jagd with inuits , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make mistakes -- those who constrain the battlefield and those who constrain the battlefield and those who have good results .
i don &apos;t have to adjust these things emotionally , because right around the corner there will always be another crazy , colorful , outfit that only wakes for me if i love a little bit in my heart and search .
now , deciding not to buy a glass of brand is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our diary -- but it turns out that the overload problem also affects us with very consequence decisions .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do its work , because we &apos;re afraid to do it , is a real sleeve gas , and it holds millions of people off the thrive .
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up less happy with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
they also have three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite human participation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and when is , of course , a little bit intuitive , and how can i , as a creator , influence this and shape things like that , that they &apos;re user-friendly , that &apos;s possible , because then they &apos;re fun and easy to use ?
but when i was telephone with him , and i asked him why he was making these interventions -- it was high-risk surgeries -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be treated very badly , and therefore he had to do it .
suppose you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved cardiac person with bloody cardiac disease , and your doctor has a cardiologist whose average performance is in coloration at 200 .
both in my profession at robin hood and in my side career as a volunteer fireman , i am witnessing generosity and friendliness on scale , but i also see closest love and mute of individuals .
so i &apos;ve started thinking , and i certainly think in the past few months , while i &apos;ve worked on this book that &apos;s about to appear -- as the dangerous , scary , highly expected follow-up of my success .
i &apos;m a designer of house , so of course i &apos;m also involved in the subject of curiosity , and how curiosity also changes our thinking again , and why maybe we &apos;re also going to lose curiosity , and so on and so forth .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious one that immediately jumps up without being able to do something about it , and the things that you know that look very different , that you can sound much better for you and others .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach a hand and didn &apos;t do it , all the fences i wanted to flick , all the experiences i wanted to make and never made .
so we started with a number of volunteers who helped us , a little over a year ago , in seattle , tag the things that they waited away -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that they would throw away anyway .
so this whole discussion of how is going to move right now , energy turn , how to go , on the island , for example , we have five to 30 percent accuracy energy , so we have to control the wind and the sun .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the setting of a massive confrontation that has been ravaged for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
tan le , anonymous editor of footscray , was now tan , refugee and social activist , who was invited to speak in places she &apos;d never heard of , and in places whose existence she could have never imagined .
and it turns out that under a 60,000 dollars a year &apos;s income , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a 600,000 dollars a year &apos;s income .
i think that the interactive media within us has been addressing archaic , cognitive models , so thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time ago , and that we can just regenerate them through interactive media right now .
i think i &apos;m more likely to be aware that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome viencies , but we &apos;re open to hugging them to grab them at the bow to even use a fight expression and maybe even dance with them .
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water memory inside , inside that they can actually recover to cellulosic base , then they can plant with a baby in israel or in tunisia in hundreds of hundreds of trees .
if i took this post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone would think of me as a person who can &apos;t walk their lives in any positive way , but today , i &apos;m celebrated for the odds and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so , she runs to the house , she looks for the paper , and the poem goes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it goes through through her and then she goes through -- she said -- she said -- it was like grasping her other hand and grabbing her .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all talk one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be that language of yoruba . let it be canonical .
and before that back , i &apos;ve been in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation in human computer in which the human computer &apos;s relationship is concerned with how our tools , or how the computer is changing from the computer to the digital assistant .
afterwards , the ancient tyrannian civilization populated the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , and as a result of the conquest , these people moved back to an isolated volcanic massive , rising above the caribbean coastal plain .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and chairs , just to discover and just look through , immediately characterized by visibility and access to information , especially in terms of business skills -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i spoke to a few years ago that had brought a few siamese twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
what we &apos;ve learned from cross-cultural studies is that women , on average -- not every but on average -- tend to tend to give a lot of attention to complex social relationships and the worry for people who are vulnerable within the group .
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to put together a stereo system -- loudspeakers , cd players , a cassette player , radio , stronger . and in this one electronics business , there are so many stereos .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you think about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that available if things get faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
this was a huge buzz at the time , because , of course , you start manipulating the living language in the form of writing , which means what fluid and living is , i start and i grab it in stone , and i manipulate it .
so to put these theories up , let &apos;s remind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely high-gram sabotage , it has to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections have been reported .
i think they were so brave and so radically in what they did , that every few years i took a look at the malcious musical valve in 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
they knew that about 75,000 hondurans left their country every year to go out to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in hduras .
among then , there are things that have come totally in the day-to-day , which most people don &apos;t even know , for example , are washing enzymes that allow us to wash at 450 degrees of laundry , are also genetically optimized enzymes .
what kindergarten kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow and prototype , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so they have a multi-times the opportunity to repair bloody prototypes .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights to people like this , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden retriever that probably deserve soundscapes more than some people i know .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem-solvers all over the world , if we take attacking the barriers of the next century , the face of those who are at the edge of an epic victory .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics is not a convincing thing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website receives 35 million exquisions every month .
in some of the expeditions i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermalsources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before and had found at the time when we saw them had no words at all .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m initially italian , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is because of something very interesting happening in formula 1 in the last few decades .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 most retail catastrophic , they saw that the revenues went up 87 percent -- a result of both , the increase in sales and reducing cost .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of fortune 50-business , and there &apos;s something about this task that allows deep insights to be able to be able to communicate with them in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share with some of them .
we took a ps3 camera , we put it apart , we put it on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , the software can be downloaded for free .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year out and work in an environment that is pretty much everything they hate , we made them work in government .
and you can see already that you have our seven senses , most of us think we only have five , now it &apos;s even seven people recognized , and i &apos;m sure that in the near future , there &apos;s the next , mind-wandering sense , and as an extension of ourselves .
but that &apos;s my prototype that looked like this , which was pretty much out of the way , on a branch like this , that thing leaped on it , attached electronics on it , and pressure , but that was too high , the thing broke .
it was on a piano course for music students in my beloved old teacher , professor jhurgade , a well-known beethoven specialist , concert pianist and long-standing professor of music school here in stuttart .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines do , is we think at a certain level of abstraction , we overlay that machine , and the machine does it with something that exceeds our skills far higher , better and faster than we could ever do .
we look in this web , we see the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s nine comma hertz , we start to do a few valves , then a little bit of merh steam comes back up again .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought molecules were shooting around in a particular way rather than a random way of getting around a handle on the field of nature .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals of those people , 60,000 years ago , had worn older people and people with severe physical injuries , and maybe that happened , because the life experience of these people was valuable for society .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or pay a rise by four percent by the amount they were willing to pay for the savings account .
now we have &quot; three hives &quot; laws that always bring people behind bars for a bicycle theft , for the theft , for the little bit of good , rather than that you force them to give things back to the victims .
and then the next one , which has been working on a nice neural model or mental model , like the software eergonoma , which is that you would have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable .
and yes , so , you can see it &apos;s relatively heterogeneous , so that &apos;s where there &apos;s been content from people doing it alone to big , so larger organizations that are already doing it more formal in institutionalized form .
now , i must confess when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but every year , it &apos;s come to my growing doubt .
i &apos;m a professional historian , and in this case , i study how humans went to anatomy -- that is , human bodies , animal bodies -- how they went to fluids with body concepts , how they thought about bodies .
and as through a miracle , he took his violin and began to play a few incisions of violin concerts , and then asked me to play them at the end : black son , tsheikowski , sibelius .
what you have to do there may seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to capture all the co2 coming out of the chimneck after the burning , and then put it under pressure , and then laughing somewhere , and hope it stays there .
i committed myself to the place and to his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way that he can do his art again .
the spirits can be cut up from underneath the great water , respond to the rhythm of dance , to push the soul of the living , so that the akolyth becomes the god for a short shining moment .
so if i do that now , the profilers in the crime place , go , collect any hair samples , and then they turn that technique on , and then they can say , o.k , that hair belongs to that human being .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like this . centuries ago in the deserts of north africa , people gathered into monthly fears with sacred dances and music that had been kept for hours -- to dawn .
he contain the dog , and improvised a shoot , took the skeleton of the dog , improvised a sleepy , pasted a different dog , and swrecked over the icebands with the colored knife on the belt .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt the evidence of my expert on mammography , &quot; or any cancer jellyfish who &apos;s going to treat his patients with caffe-envelope .
the reason why kids with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s a carcage or a siamesian twins , whether it &apos;s intersexual -- from surgeons often are adapted to the norm is not because it &apos;s your physical health of advantage .
again , the idea is , imagine the idea that we reengage people to do something and change the environment -- almost something we call to incorporate cloud motion , how to move a check , but with a cloud .
heinrich , because you assume he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you he &apos;s xy -- because he &apos;s a male , he can now be attracted to what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad sitting jeans if there &apos;s only one way to buy it is that if you &apos;re unhappy , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
&quot; when we fought against oppression in eastern europe , we wanted all sorts of things . but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in hopeless places , and to be witness . &quot;
and it &apos;s even better , the things you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photo , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- are literally now being dematerialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
i graduated , and i hope that the video works , a very , very nice project , which is the bachelorship work by michael burk , ann-kathrin krence , joris klause and jan-moritz trash .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do because our science is making such progress in the anatomy area that we have to reach a point where we have to admit that democracy that is based on anatomy could fall apart ?
the leaders of the government in hduras were pointed to the help of partnerships , they could benefit from their partnerships countries that they would help build the laws for this charter and permission , that anyone could trust the charter is really underway .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we made a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation ever , and i think quite often in relation to how many years ago i think of other holidays .
and maybe even a little bit of a view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things in all sorts of post-humane futures that i can think of as a science fiction fan .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the power of bringing new elements into play -- like the testicles -- and also how the game needs both trust and promotes -- while at the same time it &apos;s making tremendous fun .
the reason for this is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , these are years here , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a random measure of technology that i want to present with a graph , the graph will be silly .
by playing music and talking about music was from this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , skilled , skilled , skilled musician in juilliard .
so where the founding fathers were extremely concerned about figuring out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more complaining more of a concept , not just how to protect each other , but how to care about each other .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avoid things that you &apos;re not sure of , you &apos;re not afraid , you &apos;re going to avoid these elements , and you &apos;re welcome them , and you &apos;re actually turning them into something positive for yourself , and that &apos;s a historical chess .
we don &apos;t have the situation like in iran , for example , where a man who feels sexually drawn to other men who are punished with death , unless he &apos;s willing to commit a gender transformation in which case he can stay alive .
and they &apos;re going to get healthier by using the tricoder , and they &apos;re better trained by the khan academy , and by having the opportunity to use 3d printers and infinite computing , to be much more productive than they &apos;ve ever had before .
so the main reason for this is that maybe we enjoy looking at these huge shelves of mayonaise , mustard , essimist and brand , but we can &apos;t actually draw the comparison and limitations and actually choose something from the fantastic deal .
so if you look at google glass , for example , then one of the concepts is that , again , what the virtual world is bringing us back to the real world , which is our moninity to virtualization , to feel the virtual natural as something normal is being reacted .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i did with gur huberman , eme kamenica , wei jang , in which we &apos;re looking at the decisions for retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 places throughout the united states .
but because only one company , one agency , was willing to help us -- and that was because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with my team directly and go to the companies with my team .
and this curiosity also turned out that whenever i was not in school , i went through the forests of stretches , and i went and collected samples , frogs and snakes and beetles , and beetles , and i looked at them all home and looked under the microscope .
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly hears a little fragment of a tune that , as it often is in inspiration , is elusive to him . and he wants to have it . she &apos;s gorgeous . he lethes afterwards , but he can &apos;t grasp it .
here &apos;s another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , he lived as a man , and he had just figured out that he had eggs and a uterus .
in fact , i &apos;ve set myself up the vast majority of my career in the case of terrible situations , and all of this for trying to study social belonging in ways that they are compelling and interesting , and hopefully , in a way , understand what makes them fun and accessible to the audience .
and we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the modern artist who was trying to dominate this uncontrollable creative impulse that lived in him and deal with them .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , in how little appetite do i have on the toes of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question : why do we give memories so much weight in the course of the weight that we give experiences ?
she ran like the devil while she was pursued by this poem , and it was all about getting enough paper and a piece of pen and a pencil so that if it went through her , she could capture it and stick it on the sheet .
the next weeks , i was making imaginations , and i first learned the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to your colleagues about it .
you can think of this cultural web as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be defined as the sum of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been created by the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we must admit that nature doesn &apos;t draw a line between male and female , or between male and sexual and sexual and intersexual , and tactical ; it &apos;s us , in a sense , to which that line is natural .
so what they got was this : here &apos;s your name : my tedtalk , which they have no idea what the topic is going to be , which could ever , after content , fly around the ears , especially if i let their company go for their participation .
and in this song , we will rediscover the possibility of being what we are : people with people with full consciousness , who are aware of the importance of all humans and gardening need to be able to flourish a space , and there are great moments of optimism .
these older people are coming to me now and saying , &quot; mr , stevenson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re telling talks . they &apos;re telling people to stop saying that for the first time in the history of our nation , we have to deal with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
there are some pilot projects that can do this at a 60 percent level , 80 percent level , but to get it to 100 percent , and to get it to an agreement to get carbon sheet is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the warehouse question .
we worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the √©tole at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scale in mailand -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use them as a impulse for the stream fire .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect for a while , and it may seem odd that a magician is interested in it , unless you consider it the way i think of it , as &quot; a deception which is going to happen when somebody believes in a firm enough of it . &quot;
as a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , and they &apos;re so bad sometimes , and he &apos;s disappearing in the streets of scid row , always subject to this horror and the torture of his own mind .
we followed the geneaology eight generations back , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people something about it , they assumed that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with the spear .
and the people back or those people who look at this at video at some point will say , &quot; well , that looks quite impressive , but if it were real , it would -- look , here &apos;s a hole , and there , if it were really real , it would float . &quot;
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that came to the market recently was about how to best get the choices , was something that david laibson has been very strongly founded , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
at this point , the patients can come in . they can not only take control , be chapters on their own ship , but can also help us in health care with the challenges that are ahead of us , and the cost explosion of health , double-demand , and so on .
so , the tedtalk in very simple form represented that a charter city is a place whose first country is uninhabited , a founding contract that determines the laws that are out there , and the people are willing to decide whether to live in either of these rules or not .
about an hour after she arrived at home , after sending her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 , and the rescue assistants brought her back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock state .
well , what this thing does is it takes the infecting values of sensors -- so for example , by printing sensors and vibrational sensors -- and it provides legitimate code that still runs during the attack , with false data .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the malayan coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple to give me one of the men on the platform .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it processes information doesn &apos;t count them , one , two , three , but it sees them as a group .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of advocating plants find these two morphologically unrelated plants that , if combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who &apos;s freaked up when he &apos;s retired , because he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s very good at branding when he &apos;s covered in one meter snow .
and then there &apos;s a memory of ourselves , and the memory of self is the one that counts and receives the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor speaks to by asking the question , &quot; how have you felt lately ? &quot;
if you just gave me one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is , halved energy cycle , without co2 , i would take that wish .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we look at all these genes that we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to one living cell .
and there was a time when there was only jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they missed them , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and when they carried long enough and often washed enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
now this could happen within a single organism &apos;s lifetime , whereas before that , hundreds of thousands of years before that , because that information had to be learned by the individuals who died because of that fruit , because these information processing structures were not there .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything was started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story about it , which is that at that time , little oil droplet would sniff around , which had different kinds of recipes for chemicals .
and these sounds and this rhythm have put together the geology that topography of a region has shown , and it has of course also allowed you to defragment these songs and put them differently and move to the left , to the right and also to the outward .
how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we reclaim , and we expect that the government , our values , to reflect our needs , and then didn &apos;t change much ?
you do it for the will for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment . you do it for the exploration , and because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually extend the reflection of patient a by simply letting the tube in without too much of it .
and if you do this for a few minutes , you &apos;ve been proven that the living self of patient a &apos;s is worse off it , and you &apos;ve proven that the memory of the patient is much better off , because now you &apos;ve given patient a a a a better story about his experience .
i took them with and shepherded them down to the world : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they look around , samples and test instruments and so on .
and all this time , they are culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that keep the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that ecological -- equilibrium .
and , if i step out again and look at everything , maybe i can rearrange my course into my search past , here , i &apos;m looking for nepotistic , here for bing , or here for live labs .
now , understand that this is not only that people have to eat dog food when they &apos;re retired because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , but it also means making decisions so hard that they miss large investment employees in their employers .
that , as a translator , you have to translate that text into another language , but also understand the deeper sense of words and literacy slopes so that it makes a meaningful translation , everybody who has to do with foreign languages .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a water facility , rather than just for these fish , but for you and me .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicator in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper that said , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except for evolution . &quot;
because of the ocean , bacteria are there that are thermophil , and by doing so , the hot dam will survive otherwise , if fish were there , it would have vacuum cooked fish at the end of it , but they managed to make a habitable environment for themselves .
what if you could change the sperm and the egg or the newly fertilized egg to give your kids a better chance for a healthier life -- elimination of diabetes , eliminating the hemophilia , reducing the risk of cancer ?
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of humans is being judged in general , but the ethnic , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , is not only judged , but celebrated as part of a developing strategy .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a chapter soundso watching big fish happen in this area cannot be used , or of fishermen scientists , normally not being acquired because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
i &apos;ve had to repeat individual practice a lot of times with these thick , elastic bands -- in different colors -- you know , that &apos;s what you know to build my leg muscles , and i hated these benches more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i swept them . i hated them .
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome . it &apos;s got more than 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it from the size of the virus , which we could vary the size of the tape to understand what the components of a living cell are .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it yourself , i want to share with you something -- he gave me permission -- his technique , called the slingshot , which many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator at the student &apos;s home .
&quot; cloud-computing , &quot; which my friends at autodesk call &quot; infinite computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow for personal production on our planet to be able to democratized , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccines and food , digital medicine , nano-materials and artificial intelligence .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo-acolyths in a tranceding state , empowering glowing coal without burning , an astonishing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body in such a way that it keeps when it gets placed into a state of extreme conviction .
this was the most surreal form of a d√©j√©-like vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i drill around a corner , i always knew what would happen in the light bulb of the vehicle , because i had gone over the film for months when we turned the movie .
and s o with this premise then brian degger , for example , tried to put together a minimum cord in england , then picked such a steam of coverage , a heating plate , and , yes , so soup breakthroughs , and then grew bacteria .
in this image , i &apos;ve laid a bush as a center of branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing ones at the top of these branches have had success in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has demonstrated the environment of fitness and strength .
and then just came from the do-it-yourself bio org website of the founders , and i said , o.k , we &apos;ve got to really meet now too , meet real , and then organized two events , one in london , two thousand , and just for a minute in the u.s. , in san francisco .
a group of ankara , which i &apos;ve met a while ago , they have this , which is a student group who would like to teach more about the public what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve done so on street little actions , and they &apos;re trying to explain to people what d.n.a is .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that will depend on the number of people , of the services that every human uses on average , the average energy for every service and the co2 that is emitted per unit of energy .
and the realization of president lobo was that the wisdom of the passage that i &apos;ve thought about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build this city could be equally important for all the parties in honduras that have been suffering from fear and suspicion for many years .
i read this list of a friend of mine loud , and i first had to laugh , and it worked so ridiculous , but i just came to &quot; train , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk to you any more , and i had to stop reading and collect me for the first time after this random word , and the associated emotional shock .
i believe a significant -- not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide is that people have experienced disappointing because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain these experiences , think it would be their fault .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s walk forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . you wouldn &apos;t have thought we were going to have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
this really works , this is done in academic form , and we thought , well , okay , we might get that , then we took a webcam that screens up , turns the lens off , and then you have a microscope that scales up about four hundred times .
the neolithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at this moment joined the cult of the saatcorn , which created the poetry of the shaman through the prose of priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and overshooting -- took place only 10,000 years ago .
that &apos;s when you focus on a laser beam , on one in the room , so you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move them in that focus , so that &apos;s captured , so it &apos;s basically like a tractor beam .
if i show you 600 magazines and i split them into 10 categories or i show you 400 magazines and split them into 20 categories , then you think i gave you more choice and a better choice than i gave you the 400 experience of if i gave you the 600 .
it would be great if we could exchanging that paradigm of normal thinking against another of possibilities or strength to even more dangerous , so we can release that pattern of very many children &apos;s minds , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it works reasonably , you &apos;re only in the 100 million .
i mean , most of our lives -- and i calculated that -- you know , the psychological present is true of about three seconds , which means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a lifetime . there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any trace in one month .
the first thing that when you get a child , as a baby , is that you care about what divorces you have like this , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the potter , the more , the more , the more , of course , their curiosity is wound up .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket if they don &apos;t count the 10 extra olive oil and 12 balsamicoessig they could buy to make a huge number of their own salat dessings , in the unlikely case that none of the 175 is right for them .
and it was really , really bitter , and then you get into that period , and that actually went through a picture where i wondered after 10 years , a thousand d marrow , which was still at the time , basic , insightful in the collective of course , to be that great .
what i &apos;m going to first show you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve given microsoft as part of an exception just one year ago , and that &apos;s seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where they can either be locally or away with huge amounts of visual data .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you much more about the experience and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk about the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the numberment of our environment .
and i tried to expand this a little bit in my lab , and then bought me so much of the steady hand-hand equipment on ebay , and did a little d.n.a analysis , tried to do a father &apos;s test , so that &apos;s how / d.n.a fingerprinting is going to go back home .
but if you buy a new color laser printer this year in 2011 from the leading laser printing factories and print a page , this page has printed bright yellow spots on every page in a pattern that clearly retracks the page on you and your printer .
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means that he ended up taking the hammer and threw it on moses -- in fact , you can still still see a little spot underneath -- and said , &quot; perch√© non parli ? why don &apos;t you say ? &quot;
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the hard position of inheritance have them as orginian and colorful , but they sort of narrow to the past as the real world , meaning our world .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we either blame rousseau and the old framework of noble wild , which in his simplification is a racist thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
and if you choose another vacation between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you get an answer , and if you think about memories , you could get another answer .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and using anonymous and aggregated information from this network , which is being collected from the operators anyway to understand how the city works .
in our desire to protect the people who care about us and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast or even prognosis to the quality of life that she expects , we need to watch that we don &apos;t have the basic framework that someone &apos;s actually disabled .
because we are such a self-delusion of being great , descending from the highest beings , not from such a granted , of something that &apos;s unpredictable , like an organism that still exists , comparable to a rock and other things that are inexquisite to us .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that mimic the problem of decision-overload -- limited -- get rid of the excess alternatives ; concrete it -- do it real ; categorize -- we can better deal with more categories , fewer possibilities ; we can prepare for complexity .
he spoke in a very healthier and social tone about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never make it into baseball world series , and all of this because of the tacky passage of the first violin in the last sentence by beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures that take commands from divinity .
but we don &apos;t even listen to someone like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of statements for so long . somehow we &apos;ve embraced the notion so embodied and collective that creativity and suffering somehow belonged , and that art at the end , always leads to the souelelqual .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the convenience of the life of an unknown suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who graduated every day as long as 20 years , telling and submitting each other the stories of their day , we still have three of us in the same bed .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 to 90-odd percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last 10 , the last 20 , the last 20 , the 20 percent renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work , that you &apos;re going to do it from batteries .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be an access problem , it can be something that simplifies things like things , so any problem you want to ask a question , and how can you do it differently or how can you do it better ?
and have simulated wind and sun , and the load came to the conclusion , a very exciting conclusion that you get out of the conventional system after 20 years a mid-power rice of about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour , about 40 cents a kilowatt-hour , about four cents .
and one day he watched me do one of my exercises -- these practices were just tiring and miserable -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to one day smash one of these beaks .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to confine , and unimportant possibilities get rid of , well , then there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a cost of reducing , &amp; amp ; d and there &apos;s an improvement in decision-making .
a continent is always released , because the guess was that there are no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course there was one , and voodoo is simply the remain of this very profound religious thought that came out during the tragic diaspora of slavery .
steer grain of vegetables , skull control of monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken eggs , and all the time the agricultural industry just asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how horrible could that be ? &quot;
but the process and the heavy admiration that surrounds it was raised when he took the genius out of it , where he was not causing anything to be a trouble and left him back to where he was sort of coming from , he realized that it wasn &apos;t an internal , torturing thing .
this curious event was that i was writing a book recently -- a biography called &quot; rare , pray , love , love , &quot; which , unlike all of my previous books going out into the world for any reason , became a big mega-event , international pollinator thing .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snake of work and all the other things that we really care about is government , at the core , in the words of tim o &apos;rilly , &quot; what we do in common , that we cannot do alone . &quot;
but will 17 brand partners who were willing to take control of this control that wanted to do business with someone as mindful and playful as me , and who ultimately enabled us to tell stories that we didn &apos;t usually have -- stories that a cup would never normally support .
but in fact , they &apos;d been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never make it reasonable if it worked , but ever since there &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes ! with the right material approach , it looks like it &apos;s working .
that seems to be a little bit disgusting at first , so i repeat it so that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
not through recent mice and tractor inventions , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through chain acids , but through forests , not through fishing boats and nets , but through fish in the sea .
and where you can see how far we &apos;ve gone from what we really wanted to reach and could do , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , open up has a program , until 20 , you want to be here climattral , right ?
with total transparency , which is the new thinking , which is what &apos;s banging on old thinking , don &apos;t say that in lasagne horses and no beef is no longer beef or other phenomena , which is i just want to dress this up and i want to kundle it .
in my 20-year medical sentience and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical trial on medical errors and false treatments to learn everything i could for one of my first articles , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
well , not exactly what i had hoped for , but i went up -- the stairs up , down the halls , down the hallway , down the hallway , down the hallway , down the hallway , down the hall , down the hall , down the hall , down the hall , down the hall , down the hall , down the hall , down the hall , down the river , on the real &quot; firemen , who had already been with the exterior for the triggers .
maybe we &apos;ll have a moderate contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core message here is that we need to work on all five of them , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they shock us , because all of them have significant problems .
she wasn &apos;t fast enough in other paintings . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house , and the poem rolled through them , and she missed it . she said it would move beyond land , and -- as she said -- she looked for another poet search for a different poet .
upattributes are things that are playful , like the fresh prince , timely , exceeful , exempt , and lovely like erol flynn , agile , professional , magical and mystic like gandalf .
they &apos;re summarizing the out-of-print co2 that leads to temperature increase , and that increase in temperature has some very negative consequences . effects on weather and maybe worse , the indirect consequence that the natural systems cannot adapt to such fast changes , and so the whole systems collapse .
that &apos;s got a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and partnerships with scientists to deal with these technologies and ask questions and process the creative process , there &apos;s museum exhibitions and yes , all kinds of things .
now , if you are one of those who is not accepting the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn out your listening , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn school tz &apos;s book , which is wrong , because nothing else will make sense of you in this talk .
a few years ago , the laser prize was awarded to the scientist shinya amanaka -- a cell potentially capable of doing his research in which he took a grown-ups , a fibroid , and by manipulating only four genes , the cell , to take them back to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell is potentially able to become any cell in your body .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all sorts of batteries that are made : the ones that are made for cars , computers , cell phones , cell phones , pockets , for everything . and i &apos;ve compared that to the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , i found that all batteries that we &apos;re producing now could store less than 10 minutes of all of the energy we &apos;re producing .
now let &apos;s step back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , perhaps three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , which , in the last 130,000 years , form .
this is a reconstruction of cathedame &apos;s cathedame , who , only happened in the computer with images of flickr . just put in notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get images of men in t-shirts and on the university sites , etc . each of these orange coat represents a picture that was detected as hearing about this model .
i &apos;d like to show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in summer to show you what i think is really the pointer behind this technology , photosynthetic technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
if one is no said no , the vetopcca , which has completely crushed you , and i have been struggling with whether i &apos;ve taken my great engineering degree , maybe really waste to a shy thing , because all my father &apos;s colleagues have always talked to him , you &apos;ve taken the money out into your window when you &apos;re kid .
in other words , sugar pills , in some studies , have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s only because the person thinks about what &apos;s happening to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in pain management , for example , if the patient believes only enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
i went to lhasa first with a young colleague of 6,000 miles from chengdu , in west china , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear about . 6,000 sacred monuments that have been turned into shock and ashes , 1.2 million people who have been murdered during the cultural revolution by the caves .
we cleaned up the chromosome of a microbes . and in rough said , these are from each other as far apart as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome . we broke it up with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very sophisticated graphs here .
margaret mead , who said big anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that while we move towards a thread , unstaggered , generic world view , we would not only see the entire range of human imagination reduced in a finite way , but one day we would have been waking up from a dream , and forgotten that there have ever been any possibility .
and so the idea is that now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have a little bit later on -- and that &apos;s why investment is not that clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there are people in the rich world looking at ipccc and saying , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we humans are going to -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted to death , 11 times higher , when that is victims than when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher than when the prosecuted black and the victim knows -- in the same state where the body borrows born people in their bodies .
it means that a little child from the andeans who grow up believing that the mountain is an apu-spirit that determines their destiny will become a different human , and will have a different relationship with this resource or this place , as a little child from montana who grows up in believing that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be dismissed .
i had such a encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who is now over 90 , but she told me her entire life was denser , and she told me that when she was growing up in the local virginia , she said she could feel and hear a poem about the landscape coming up on her .
these people have come to wealth online , but they have been illegal by using trojans , for example , to raise money from our bank accounts while we &apos;re doing our online banking online banking , or also keylovers , collecting our credit card information on the keyboard while buying over an infected computer online .
usually my role is to explain to people how wonderful new technologies that have come up will be , and i thought , since i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s going on here with these incredible leaps forward , which happen so fast that we can barely mimic .
and that would be their answer to the bjoun lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from it , the poverty reduction , the reduction of malaria , and so on , there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money on it , while there are better things we can do .
and that made me a different human than my friends in the kwakiutl who believe that these forests would be involved in their hamasachs place and the conbounded celestial beast and the cannibalic spirits that live on the northerners of the world , spirits that they would be participating in their hamatsa-initiation .
woman parks kept coming back to montgomery , where she met two of her oldest friends , these older women , johnnie carr , who had organized the montgomery busyboard -- an incredible african boyoter -- and virginia durr , a white woman whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king .
and they got up there two builders of this , and they said , &quot; o.k , we make this easier and cheaper , and they just got out of open source , which is free hardware , electronics , which is stuff that &apos;s going to assemble this device , and they &apos;re actually now the least cheap providers of these devices in the world .
and i want to also hold towards biology right now , and i want this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the d.n.a code is an abstract code that , yes , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s more matter , so real matter , and it &apos;s not just cyber .
a week ago at the national academy of engineering , the dragon prize for francis arnold and wild stemmer , two scientists who , independently , developed the natural process of evolution to encourage the process of working faster and desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- which , france arnold calls &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at brighton university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he thinks the book and the image , so not television , the internet , etc . , and so on , what we call today , as a mass media , has fossilized the memories of our memories , and has virtualized our ability to virtualize .
now , this was a very simple trick , of course , by dr. p. to do the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to do , in the sense that the richest five year-old girl in the hospital was going to be in the second hive , but he actually made me see my daily practice horror with new eyes , so it became a new and diverse experience .
as i &apos;ve been looking for models for this over the past year to do this , i &apos;ve also been looking for in the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they may have had better or more reasonable ideas about this than we can , how to help with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
so we have this kind of situation where , the further our science progresses , we have to admit ourselves so much more , that these categories that we had thought were stable anatomic categories , which made very simple arrangements to create permanent identities , are much more embarrassed than we thought .
and when these people came and saw who is the best protein folder in the world , this was not a mit professor , even a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked as an assistant of business in a reha-clinic , and at night was the best protein maker in the world .
this sentence from dealing with viencies lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge without being coined by the experience of the interconnected , as though my life had run so well , because i could avoid the possible life with a prosthetic , or whatever humans perceive me with my disability .
really , some happy people and corporations , for-profit and non-profits , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let this go again -- buy the nameless rights at the talk that you &apos;re seeing , who didn &apos;t have a lot of content at the time , and didn &apos;t give a lot of clues about what the topic was going to be .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times the amount of energy that you can , say , a coallear molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with problems , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , the impact on land and other things , almost in your own league .
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and filming the secret societies that were secure the foundations of duvalians and clay macoutes and the poison that was used to make zombies .
so i went home and ate with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a second , if there &apos;s this technology that can be used to control your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that tempt can control a laser , so that he can do graffiti again , that would be brilliant . &quot;
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i deal with viencies , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence never fits for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable about answering the questions of people , and i think , gradually , i understand why .
and if i translate this now , for example , in which i take an oversight of , select it as a choice , informed in the case , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , transaction , i can throw it somewhere or send it to somebody , or buy it and so on .
i recommend to all of you to read steves &apos;s book or to watch the movie so that you understand not only the wonderful connection between these two men came out , but also how music helped that connection connect , and how it ended up being the instrument if that word was allowed to get the mithalf , nathaniel off the street .
you can see at the bottom of this picture there is the lab , in leadership , so one of these informed garage with so much everything that the university has been doing , a group in paris that &apos;s been doing what &apos;s set up and doing pretty interesting things , and i want to do another project for a second .
and then , partly , if you look at the software that we just saw , you &apos;ll also understand why ninety-nine percent of our software today is little intuitive or not usb , including the ipad in many areas or iphone , although it &apos;s much more intuitive than classical software .
the computer vision-algorithms have stuck these pictures together so that they can confront the real space in which these shots all have been made near the grassi lake in the canadian rockies . you can see here elements of stated slides or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been spatically related .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t come to a place yet , and there are a lot of interesting openings for everything that has been called &quot; nuclear . &quot; there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was here and i met the minister of energy and talked about how this fits to the energy agenda .
for example , no biologist would claim that 50 percent or more of all species are about to die , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenarium in the field of biological diversity -- is barely equivalent to what we know as the most optimistic censorship in the field of cultural diversity .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the burden of responsibility for making decisions from someone who knows something -- namely the ph.d. -- is somebody who knows nothing and is highly ill , and therefore , not in the best constitution is to make a decision -- namely the patient .
we also have one of those same aggregate in the same size as it stands there , put it in the hall to actually simulate the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall it looks like this now , there &apos;s the back here , there &apos;s the big battery , there &apos;s all the judges with which we simulate the web .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of me , pray , love , love . i fell into one of those grubs of doubt that we all fall into when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you begin to think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . it &apos;s the worst book ever written .
if i want to bring one thing to you today is that the sum of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , i want you to think about how we can use information to get patterns and recognize trends that wouldn &apos;t otherwise .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature that was believed to be living literally in the walls of an artist -- sort of like dobby , the housef -- who was coming out and an artist at work would sort of be invisible and would design the outcome of the work .
so we did a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro atmosphere tero , we did a study with the people at ing -- employees that all worked for the work -- and these people were all in a convention where they signed their participation in their retirement plan .
so , the fact is that , in 300 years , you will remember not for your wars or your technological innovation , but rather than an era where we were involved and accepted and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth either actively supported or passively accepted . so , the problem is not the change .
i was afraid not because of it , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that he could sink into one of his states and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin if i started talking about tons and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic gateekeepers .
i &apos;m probably listening to these two nice girls , i &apos;m probably a generation that has been nurturing for this bad oko image , because i &apos;ve already begun to study machine engineering in karlsquiet , technological college , now she says , &quot; i think , kit . &quot;
now today , if you want to win a race , you actually need something like this -- something that overlaps the car in real time , has a couple of thousands of sensors that are going to pass information out of the car , pass this information into the system , and then process it and then use it to send back decisions back to this car and change things in real time as information is being collected .
interesting historical footnote : when the moars were conquering southern spain , they brought this practice . the language changed over the centuries of ze allah , allah , allah &apos;s affectionate style to strings , ol√© , ol√© &apos;s , ol√© &apos;s , that you still hear when you &apos;re fighting and flamenco dances .
i had written this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which was supposed to push the measurement in things like visual effects and computer-generated effects across new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters made using cg , and the main figures should be all cg . and the world should be cg .
it &apos;s actually the one who makes decisions , because if you have a patient who had , say , two mirrors in two different surgeons and decides what to choose , then the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s going to be selected .
you know , one of the great pleasures of traveling , and one of the pleasures of ethnography research is to live with the people who can still remember the old days , still feel in the wind , touch them on the rain , taste them in the bitter leaves of the plants .
you all know the healthy shame , when you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s prize , even though that one shrinks on divorce and then you get caught up and the best friend comes up with you and leads my terrifying discussion , if at the end you do the bad conscience , and you sworm that you never make such a mistake .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman , as part of the program -- in fact , do that all of you -- you &apos;ll all do -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call government for a lot of different problems include the fact that there &apos;s a thylacine in their house .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economic , and at the same time you can eliminate co2 , then the skeptics also say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t interest me that it doesn &apos;t emitt any co2 , i wanted it to almost do it , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question and answer meeting after one of my lectures that told a story &#91; unclear ... &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the very end of the picture , there was a terrible circling sound .
do you know ? i think , to allow a mere person that he thinks he or she is like the vessel , such as the basin and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to promote a question of human psyche .
the beauty of this is , if you do this , you create agriculture , biogas , on a hectare of five thousand people in favelas , so a farmer can raise about a thousandth of a hundred dollars , and wait for the plant , chickens and pigs and vegetables and fish .
if i were to go to a room full of colleagues and ask their immediate support and tell them what i just told you , i would not very likely reach the end of the second story before they really did unpleasant , anybody would intervene with a joke , they would change the topic and forget the rest of it .
so by looking at color , contrast and helpless at the edges of individual images , photography is adding cues like field depth , disgusted colors and disorders , we owe the boundaries between the different images and make them look like a single photo , even though a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
we &apos;re at the threshold to amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we need to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time where we have struggled , where we have made progress on these things more intense , more fronts than we have now .
and wherever you look around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not denied to the demise . these are dynamically living peoples whose existence is denied by visible forces , whose existence is exceeded by their capacity to adapt to their capacity to adaptation , whether it &apos;s the extraordinary deforestation in the homeland of penean , a nomad people from southeast asia , a people from sarawak , a people who live in the forest in the forest in now living in necessity , and now on prosthetic river , that they can see where the toxic contaminants are ready to be lowered with the mics of the mid-water , or the sludge , where they are ready to the tune in the south sea .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content to make it realistic for them , and they actually live their real lives without oil . so , if they complain to play , they tell us where they live . and then they get news movies in real time showing them how much oil costs , which is not how much food is impaired , how much transportation is impaired , whether schools are closed , whether there must be up . and then they figure out how they really live their lives would be true , and when we ask them to ask them videos , or ask them to ask them to take pictures .
what ayahuasca makes so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this preparate , but the processing is made up of two sources . it &apos;s really made up of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane , which is a series of betakarboline , harmin , harmolin , slightly hallucinated . this climbing plant alone is about as if a blue truck is on her consciousness , but it &apos;s put on the leaves of a tree of a coffee creature called the plant called the psychotridal .
simply knowing that jaguar shame still goes beyond the milky way , or the importance of the myths of the oldest of the inuit still matters , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist still pursues the breath of the dharma , means to remember the central openness of anthropology in many generations , that is the idea that the world in which we live , not in a absolute sense , but only exists as a model , as a reality of a certain set of possibilities that are successfully adapted to our own trajectory of our own generations .
how can i talk about the connection between women in 10 minutes , between three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness , in the lives of a four-year-old girl , when she , over 30 years ago , had her little sister , her mother and grandmother , five days and nights , sitting together in a small boat in the chinese sea . a connectedness that was stuck in the lives of this little girl , and never stopped -- this little girl who lives in san francisco now talking to her today ?
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan in the woods of borneo , or the voodoo acolyths in haiti , or the warriors in the caisutti desert of northern kenya , the curanderos in the advance , or a caravan sermon in the middle of the sahara . this happens to be the colleague that i traveled to the desert a month ago , or even a shepherd on the front of the qolma , the mother of the world .
of course , from the medical standpoint of view , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visual disability , knee joints from titan and artificial hip joints for age-based bodies that allow people to really take all their possibilities and beyond the limitations that allowed them to develop their natural destiny , not to even speak about social networking platforms , give people an identity in their own way , in their own way , in the world , to orient themselves to the groups that are searching themselves .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjectively : &quot; curved , helpless , useless , destroyed , disrupt , wounded , wounded , discarded , discarded , discarded , exposure , irpotent , painted , paralyzed , paralyzed , cheerful , handit senil , weak , out of which transportation , restored , repaired , broken , broken , abandoned , rejected and useless and useless .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , i think , defended , when he defused the useless experiments of his teaching , was michael faraday , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind than to assume that our scientific beliefs are inherent that there are no mysteries in nature that our triumph is scary , and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
and we do a series of trips to the ethnosphere where we take our audiences to places like this , of cultural wonder , that they can find a way to be guided by the blessed , and hopefully at one point after another , they will take the central epilogy : that this world deserves to exist in a number of different ways that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural pluralistic world where the wisdom of all human beings can contribute to our well-being .
at the end of this amazing initiation , they suddenly get taken out one day , and for the first time in their lives , at age 18 , suddenly they see a sunrise . and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to stumble on the tracks of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they learned in abstract confirms in astonishment . and the priest comes back and says , &quot; do you really see ? you really see how i told you ?
one of them is taken by the great selection of different salad ressings , when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and which is already salatdressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what has happened has this artificially imagined alternative to you regret the decision , and this regret is negative about the happiness that you had made of your decision , even if it was a good decision .
what was really extraordinary to me was that he &apos;d collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won this cuts at a letter competition in second grade , whether i &apos;d gone to hallocar stations , whether i &apos;d been on my scholarship or one of my athletic settlements , and he &apos;d been using these clips to teach his students , hmedical students from the hmedical school and the s.u.
and if you have people in front of you who are the solid conviction that you have a soul , or you can also say , who believe that they &apos;ve been brought from the soul to life , then they think of it as a violin framework about them , not of matter , but of meat and blood , a little bit of stone , to the earth of inherent , inherent , inherent , insignificant , important , yes .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interactions of our interactions with real objects -- along with my professional teacher , patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder : what if we were using computers , instead of using a mouse pointer , who moves like a digital fingertip on a flat surface ... what if we could intervene with both hands and grab data physically , and grab data as they could , as we might ?
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this , in the sense that the properties and the capabilities that we have come from the vot age that we have come to the age of the vot , and that kind of kind of freaked us up a little bit , in the machine age , that can be reactivated with the help of what we call cyber age , and that in this way , we &apos;re not actually coming back to the future , not to our roots .
the young acolyths are separated at age three and four years from their families and in a shaped world of finecis , in stone huts at the time of the glaciers for 18 years . two times of every nine years , selected to mimic the nine months of pregnancy they spent in their bodies &apos; lap , now they spend metamorphorically in the lap of the great mother .
at this point , jafour said to octavio , &quot; what happens if we take an unfinished area of our country -- what if we just put them in a message -- a part of the american embassy , a part of the canadian embassy -- and then when people want to work under the canadian rules or the united states , they can work there , and can they do everything on the surface of this messages that usually you would have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to end with a poem written by a persian poet called hafiz in the 14th century , and my friend jacques dembois told me , and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot; &quot; &quot; every child god , not the god of the name , not the god of the commandments , but the god who only knows four words and repeatedly , only always says , &quot; come dance with me . &quot;
when someone has taken their trouble and complained all of these sacred people and shared them with whom they are all of them , my photo will suddenly be attracted by the notre dam cathedral to all of this data , and i can use them as a starting point to dive into this room , into these metaverses that use other people , and thus make a kind of a broad model of social experience with other people .
of course , a huge success story , but again , we &apos;ve got the problem of a growing company , and then we &apos;ve got about two thousand , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start small again and go back and dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , and that means , in my view , it &apos;s the same crazy again , which starts back to people saying , what should the squeeze , this is not all about , we &apos;re not talking about storage .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for this in the malaria shrinks of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still , through time and ritual , they have formed a mysterious nimbus of the earth that is not based on the idea of being aware of them , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist in itself , because it &apos;s embedded in human consciousness .
so that the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to make mistakes that make people inevitable , and it also enables people to create loving , supportive spaces in which anyone who observes health care can actually address things which are possible mistakes and should even reward them , and should be specifically rewarded for people like me who make mistakes and the grace of that rewards .
i even discussed with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who introduced the psychedelic eyea to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 300s , and i suggested that you couldn &apos;t reorder these tryptamins as hallucinogens , because the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re no longer there to experience a hallucination .
many of you will know the story , because from steves articles about it , a book that was filmed back then , with robert downey junior when steve lopez and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the contrist who studied at juilliard-conservatory , whose promising career was broadly ending early through his paranoid schizophrenia .
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents are using foreign providers like gmail because they know that they can trust more than local providers , and that they &apos;re encrypted over ssl-connected connections , so that local government can &apos;t sniff around in their conversations .
for example , women who pointed out the right to vote , the concept of founding fathers , which says that anatomical communality is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we have a uterus and eggs as a difference is not significant enough that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to have the right to own the right to own the right to own , etc . &quot;
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are dealing with nasa and sit in nasa on the nasa expertise and plan real space missions , and they go to russia , and they go through the mission of biomedical protocol all around and around and on it , then fly to the international space station , and take our 3d camera stems .
in my show , &quot; white coat , black art . &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would be showing everyone from the rescue assistant to the chef of the cardiologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i &apos;m showing the microphone to him .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the weakness glass , and all the printing around , all the technology , all the difficulty , all the human performance , if you &apos;re working on lake , &quot; you just can &apos;t explain it to others . it &apos;s like policemen or soldiers who have gone through something together and know that they can never explain it to anybody .
